# AwaitedDOM Extensions 

> AwaitedDOM Extensions add extra functionality to the DOM specification in order to make using Hero easier. All extensions are prefixed with a "$" character.

These extensions are automatically added to all AwaitedDOM elements ([`Nodes`](../awaited-dom/super-node.md), [`Elements`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md), [`HTMLElements`](../awaited-dom/super-html-element.md)) and collections ([`NodeList`](../awaited-dom/super-node-list.md) and [`HTMLCollections`](../awaited-dom/super-html-collection.md)).

## Properties

### element.$contentDocument {#content-document}

Accesses a child frames ContentDocument **bypassing** cross-origin restrictions. This can be really nice when you are accessing frame querySelectors on different domains. The native javascript sandboxes do not have this privilege.

```js
await hero.querySelector('frame').$contentDocument.querySelector('button').$click();
```

#### **Returns**: `SuperDocument`

### element.$exists {#exists}

Checks if a given node is valid and retrievable in the DOM. This API is used mostly to determine if a querySelector can be resolved.

```js
await hero.querySelector('.not-in-dom').$exists; // false if not in dom!
```

#### **Returns**: `Promise<boolean>`

### element.$hasFocus {#has-focus}

Checks if a given node has focus in the DOM. Useful for form interactions.

```js
const hasFocus = await hero.querySelector('.field').$hasFocus;
if (!hasFocus) await hero.querySelector('.field').focus();
```

#### **Returns**: `Promise<boolean>`

### element.$isClickable {#is-clickable}

Checks if a given node is visible in the DOM, scrolled into view, and not masked by any other node. Follows the specification of `isClickable` from [tab.getComputedVisibility()](../advanced-client/tab.md#get-computed-visibility).

```js
await hero.querySelector('.element').$isClickable;
```

#### **Returns**: `Promise<boolean>`

### element.$isVisible {#is-visible}

Checks if a given node is visible in the DOM. Follows the specification of `isVisible` from [tab.getComputedVisibility()](../advanced-client/tab.md#get-computed-visibility).

NOTE: this does not mean the node is scrolled into view.

```js
await hero.querySelector('.element').$isVisible;
```

#### **Returns**: `Promise<boolean>`

## Element Methods

The following methods are added to ([`Nodes`](../awaited-dom/super-node.md), [`Elements`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md), and [`HTMLElements`](../awaited-dom/super-html-element.md)).

### element.$addToDetachedElements _(name)_ {#addToDetachedElements}

Converts the element to a [DetachedElement](./detached-element.md) and adds it to the [hero.detachedElements](./hero.md#detached-elements) object. The advantage of hero.detachedElements is you can use and reuse them from within [HeroReplay](./hero-replay.md) long after your Hero session has closed. This allows you to write extraction logic that can be easily iterated on without needing to reload the webpage(s).

For example, below is a simple hero script that collects the `h1` element:

```js
const hero = new Hero();
await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
await hero.querySelector('h1').$addToDetachedElements('title');
console.log('Session ID: ', await hero.sessionId);
```

You can create a second script that uses [HeroReplay](./hero-replay.md) to find the data you need without loading the website again:

```js
const hero = new HeroReplay({
  /* previousSessionId */
});
const h1 = await hero.detachedElements.get('title');
const h1Children = [...h1.querySelectorAll('div')].map(x => x.textContent);
```

#### **Arguments**:

- name `string`. The name used to retrieve this element from [hero.detachedElements](./hero.md#detached-elements).

#### **Returns**: `Promise<DetachedElement>`

### element.$clearInputText _()_ {#clear-value}

Clears out the value of an input field by performing a Focus, Select All, and Backspace.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### element.$click _(verification)_ {#click}

A normal DOM node has a `click()` API on it, but it does not trigger human-like behavior or mouse events resembling the actions of a normal user. For that reason, it can be detected if a given website is looking for it.

The `$click()` API triggers clicking on the given node using the [Interactions](./interactions.md) functionality.

#### **Arguments**:

- verification `elementAtPath` | `exactElement` | `none`. Default `elementAtPath`. Determines what [verification](./interactions.md#click-verification) should be used in this operation. A verification determines how to recover from the node disappearing from the DOM during execution.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### element.$detach _()_ {#detach}

Detaches element and returns it as a [DetachedElement](./detached-element.md) for local usage (i.e, without any need for promises or awaits).

For example, below is a simple hero script that detaches the `h1` element and uses getAttribute:

```js
const hero = new Hero();
await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
const h1Elem = await hero.querySelector('h1').$detach();
console.log('Session ID: ', h1Elem.getAttribute('title'));
```

You'll notice the h1Elem above has full access to properties and methods without needing the `await` keyword.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<DetachedElement.Element>`

### element.$type _(...typeInteractions)_ {#type}

Perform a typing interaction on the given node. This is a shortcut for `focusing` on an input and then performing `keyboard` operations using the [Interactions](./interactions.md) functionality.

```js
await hero.querySelector('.field').$type('fill-in', KeyboardKey.Enter);
```

#### **Arguments**:

- typeInteractions `ITypeInteraction[]`. One or more interactions to trigger using the keyboard. TypeInteractions can be strings or `KeyboardKey` values (exported from the Hero client).

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### element.$waitForExists _(options?)_ {#wait-for-exists}

Wait for the given Node "Path" to exist in the DOM. Returns the resolved SuperElement.

```js
await hero.querySelector('.not.here.yet').$waitForExists(); // waits until this querySelector resolves.
```

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object`. Optional options.
  - timeoutMs `number`. The default timeout.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<ISuperElement>`

### element.$waitForClickable _(options?)_ {#wait-for-clickable}

Wait for the given Node "Path" to be clickable in the DOM (visible, scrolled into the viewport and unobstructed).

NOTE: this API will _not_ scroll a node into view that is offscreen.

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object`. Optional options.
  - timeoutMs `number`. The default timeout.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<ISuperElement>`

### element.$waitForHidden _(options?)_ {#wait-for-hidden}

Wait for the given Node "Path" to be unavailable in the DOM (not visible in the DOM or does not exist).

This API can be useful to wait for a modal/popup window to disppear after you click close on it.

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object`. Optional options.
  - timeoutMs `number`. The default timeout.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<ISuperElement>`

### element.$waitForVisible _(options?)_ {#wait-for-visible}

Wait for the given Node "Path" to be visible in the DOM.

Visible follows the API defined at: [`tab.getComputedVisibility`](../advanced-client/tab.md#get-computed-visibility)

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object`. Optional options.
  - timeoutMs `number`. The default timeout.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<ISuperElement>`

### element.$xpathSelector _(selector)_ {#xpathSelector}

Perform an XPath query with this node provided as the "ContextScope". NOTE: you still need to start your XPath with a '.' to indicate you wish to find nested XPaths.

This is often useful to mix and match with querySelectors when you want to select on Text values of nodes.

```js
await hero.querySelector('ul').$xpathSelector('.//[.,"LAX"]');
```

#### **Arguments**:

- selector `string`. A valid XPath selector

#### **Returns**: `Promise<ISuperElement>`

## Collection Methods

The following methods are added to ([`NodeList`](../awaited-dom/super-node-list.md) and [`HTMLCollections`](../awaited-dom/super-html-collection.md)).

### collection.$map _(iteratorFn)_ {#map}

Adds syntactic sugar to run an `Array.map` on the results and await all results. This can be useful to transform results.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<T[]>`

### collection.$reduce _(iteratorFn, initialValue)_ {#reduce}

Adds syntactic sugar to run an `Array.reduce` on the results and await a reduced result. This can be useful to transform results.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<T>`

### collection.$detach _(name?)_ {#detach}

Detaches all elements of a NodeList or HTMLElementCollection and converts them to [DetachedElement](./detached-element.md). Supplying a string as the first argument adds your elements to [hero.detachedElements](./hero.md#detachedElements).

```js
await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
await hero.querySelectorAll('h1 div').$addToDetachedElements('h1 divs');
const h1 = await hero.detachedElements.getAll('h1 divs'); // will have 2 entries
const h1Divs = h1.map(x => x.textContent);
```

#### **Arguments**:

- name `string`. The name given to all extracted HTML Elements. This name will be used to retrieve the elements from [hero.detachedElements](./hero.md#detached-elements).

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

## Resource Methods
# Flow Handling

> Flow is the definition of handlers around states a webpage can exist, and controls to restore your desired scraper script state.


Often while building a scraper script, the script is built to handle the "clean path". This path does not handle situations where a website asks you to reduce traffic requests, or has prompted for a cookie consent agreement. We found that it can be quite challenging to program around these scenarios in a clean way.

### Flow Handlers

To that end, FlowHandlers were created. FlowHandlers allow you to define a "State" that the page can be in, and a "Resolver" to correct the state and resume your "clean path". Because these are outlier paths, the expectation is that FlowHandlers will click the consent button and resume, or redirect back to the page you wish to be on (if you've been sent to another page).

```js
await hero.registerFlowHandler('CookieModal', assert => {
  assert(hero.querySelector('#cookie-modal').$isVisible);
},
async error => {
  await hero.querySelector('#cookie-modal .dismiss').$click();
});
```

NOTE: If the "flow" cannot be resumed, a FlowHandler should throw an error to indicate to a "controlling" process how to retry the activity.

### When a Flow Handler will Trigger

FlowHandlers are automatically checked anytime an AwaitedDOM error occurs. These errors are things like: an element can't be found, an element interaction failed, or waiting for an element [State](../advanced-client/tab.md#wait-for-state) timed out.

### Flow Commands

[FlowCommands](../advanced-client/tab.md#flow-commands) are ways to group a series of commands together that should be re-run as a unit when an AwaitedDOM error occurs. This is often useful in more complicated Flow scenarios: eg, where a Form validation has failed that requires re-typing information for an autocomplete list, or the Tab has redirected to an error page and the flow needs to restart. You would want to ensure all steps are run when a failure is encountered.

```js
await hero.flowCommand(async () => {
  await hero.querySelector('#field1').$click();
  await hero.querySelector('#field1').$clearInputText();

  // Failure here resumes the entire block once a FlowHandler fixes the state
  await hero.querySelector('#field1').$type('value');
});
```

Flow Commands can be nested within each other. If nested commands cannot be completed due to AwaitedDOM errors (interactions, dom errors, dom state timeouts), they will trigger the outermost block to be re-tried.
# HeroReplay

> HeroReplay is a specialized version of Hero that allows you to load and interact with previous Hero sessions without reloading the website and rerunning http traffic.

This class is barebones for the moment -- it contains a small list of properties such as retrieving DetachedElements and DetachedResources. Our long-term plans are to make this a full-fledged tool for reloading and interacting with the DOM and resources from previous Hero sessions.

## Constructor

HeroReplay accepts either a subset of Hero configuration settings, including a `replaySessionId`, or a Hero instance.

#### **Arguments**:

- _OPTION 1_ config `object` Accepts any of the following:
  - replaySessionId `string`. The sessionId of a previous session to replay.
  - connectionToCore `object`. OPTIONAL object containing `IConnectionToCoreOptions` used to connect, or an already created `ConnectionToCore` instance. Defaults to automatically booting up and connecting to a local `Core`.
- OR _OPTION 2_ config `object`.
  - hero `Hero`. An existing Hero object.

## Properties

### heroReplay.detachedElements

DetachedElements object providing access to all elements with `$detach` called from this script.

#### **Returns** [`DetachedElements`](../advanced-client/detached-elements.md)

### heroReplay.detachedResources

DetachedResources object providing access to all resources collected from this script.

#### **Returns** [`DetachedResources`](../advanced-client/detached-resources.md)

### heroReplay.sessionId

Readonly unique sessionId for this Session.

#### **Returns** `Promise<string>`

## Methods

### heroReplay.getSnippet *(key)* {#getSnippet}

Retrieves a value you previously stored with [hero.setSnippet](./hero.md#setSnippet).

```js
const heroReplay = new HeroReplay({/* sessionId */});
const when = await heroReplay.getSnippet('time');
```

#### **Arguments**:

- key `string`. The key you previously used to store the value.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<any>`
# Hero

This is the primary class to interact with Hero. The following is a simple example:

```js
const Hero = require('@ulixee/hero-playground');

(async () => {
  const hero = new Hero();
  await hero.goto('https://www.google.com');
  // other actions...
  await hero.close();
})();
```

An Hero instance can be thought of as a single user-browsing session. Each instance you create has the following attributes:

#### Replayable

An instance has a [replayable](../advanced-concepts/time-travel.md)&nbsp;[Session](../advanced-concepts/sessions.md) that will record all commands, dom changes, interaction and page events.

#### Lightweight

Instances are very lightweight, sharing a pool of browsers underneath. To manage concurrent scrapes in a single script, you can create one Hero for each scrape.

#### Single Active Tab

Hero instances can have multiple [Tabs](../advanced-client/tab.md), but only a single tab can be focused at a time. Clicks and other user interaction will go to the active tab (interacting with multiple tabs at once by a single user is easily detectable).

#### Sandboxed

Each Hero instance creates a private environment with its own cache, cookies, session data and "incognito" browser window. No data is shared between instances -- each operates within an airtight sandbox to ensure no identities leak across requests.

## Constructor {#constructor}

Creates a new sandboxed browser instance with [unique user session and fingerprints](../overview/basic-concepts). Or pass in an existing UserProfile to reconstruct a previously used user session.

A connection to the underlying Hero [Core](../advanced-concepts/client-vs-core.md) will be established on the first call.

Note: If you provide a `name` that has already been used to name another instance then a counter will be appended to your string to ensure its uniqueness. However, it's only unique within a single NodeJs process (i.e., rerunning your script will reset the counter).

```js
const Hero = require('@ulixee/hero-playground');

(async () => {
  const hero = new Hero({
    userAgent: '~ mac 13.1 & chrome >= 112',
  });
})();
```

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object` Accepts any of the following:
  - connectionToCore `options | ConnectionToCore | 'string'`. An object containing `IConnectionToCoreOptions` used to connect, or an already created `ConnectionToCore` instance. A host may be provided directly as a string. Defaults to automatically booting up and connecting to a local `Core`.
  - name `string`. This is used to generate a unique sessionName.

  - timezoneId `string`. Overrides the host timezone. A list of valid ids are available at [unicode.org](https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/37/supplemental/zone_tzid.html)
  - locale `string`. Overrides the host languages settings (eg, en-US). Locale will affect navigator.language value, Accept-Language request header value as well as number and date formatting rules.
  - viewport `IViewport`. Sets the emulated screen size, window position in the screen, inner/outer width and height. If not provided, the most popular resolution is used from [statcounter.com](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats/desktop/united-states-of-america).
    - width `number`. The page width in pixels (minimum 0, maximum 10000000).
    - height `number`. The page height in pixels (minimum 0, maximum 10000000).
    - deviceScaleFactor `number` defaults to 1. Specify device scale factor (can be thought of as dpr).
    - screenWidth? `number`. The optional screen width in pixels (minimum 0, maximum 10000000).
    - screenHeight? `number`. The optional screen height in pixels (minimum 0, maximum 10000000).

console.log('title: ', h1Elem.getAttribute.get('title'));
```

#### **Arguments**:

- elementOrResource `AwaitedDOM`. This can be any AwaitedDOM element, collection of elements, or resource(s).

#### **Returns**: `Promise<DetachedElement>`

### hero.exportUserProfile _()_ {#export-profile}

Returns a json representation of the underlying browser state for saving. This can later be restored into a new instance using `new Hero({ userProfile: serialized })`. See the [UserProfile page](../advanced-client/user-profile.md) for more details.

#### **Returns**: [`Promise<IUserProfile>`](../advanced-client/user-profile.md)

### hero.focusTab _(tab)_ {#focus-tab}

Bring a tab to the forefront. This will route all interaction (`click`, `type`, etc) methods to the tab provided as an argument.

#### **Arguments**:

- tab `Tab` The Tab which will become the `activeTab`.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

Alias for [Tab.focus()](../advanced-client/tab.md#focus)

### hero.getSnippet _(key)_ {#getSnippet}

Retrieves a value you previously stored with setSnippet.

```js
const hero = new Hero();
await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
await hero.setSnippet('time', new Date());
const when = await hero.getSnippet('time');
```

#### **Arguments**:

- key `string`. The key you previously used to store the value.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<any>`

### hero.interact _(interaction\[, interaction, ...])_ {#interact}

Executes a series of mouse and keyboard interactions.

#### **Arguments**:

- interaction [`Interaction`](./interactions.md)

#### **Returns**: `Promise`

Refer to the [Interactions page](./interactions.md) for details on how to construct an interaction.

### hero.setSnippet _(key, value)_ {#setSnippet}

Stores a JSON-able value in the session database that can be retrieved later with [HeroReplay](./hero-replay.md).

```js
const hero = new Hero();
await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
await hero.setSnippet('time', new Date());
const when = await hero.getSnippet('time');
```

To retrieve later with [HeroReplay](./hero-replay.md):

```js
const replay = new HeroReplay({
  /* previousSessionId */
});
const when = await replay.getSnippet('time');
```

#### **Arguments**:

- key `string`. The key you want to use to retrieve this value at a later time.
- value `any`. The only constraint is the value must be JSON-able.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### hero.scrollTo _(mousePosition)_ {#scroll-to}

Executes a scroll interaction. This is a shortcut for `hero.interact({ scroll: mousePosition })`. See the [Interactions page](./interactions.md) for more details.

#### **Arguments**:

- mousePosition `MousePosition`

#### **Returns**: `Promise`

### hero.type _(keyboardInteraction\[, keyboardInteraction, ...])_ {#type}

Executes a keyboard interactions. This is a shortcut for `hero.interact({ type: string | KeyName[] })`.

#### **Arguments**:

- keyboardInteraction [`KeyboardInteraction`](./interactions.md#the-four-keyboard-commands)

#### **Returns**: `Promise`

Refer to the [Interactions page](./interactions.md) for details on how to construct keyboard interactions.

### hero.use _(plugin)_

Add a plugin to the current instance. This must be called before any other hero methods.

#### **Arguments**:

- plugin `ClientPlugin` | `array` | `object` | `string`

#### **Returns**: `this` The same Hero instance (for optional chaining)

If an array is passed, then any client plugins found in the array are registered. If an object, than any client plugins found in the object's values are registered. If a string, it must be a valid npm package name available in the current environment or it must be an absolute path to a file that exports one or more plugins -- Hero will attempt to dynamically require it.

Also, if a string is passed -- regardless of whether it's an npm package or absolute path -- the same will also be registered in Core (however, the same is not true for arrays or objects). For example, you can easily register a Core plugin directly from Client:

```javascript
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero-playground';

const hero = new Hero();
hero.use('@ulixee/tattle-plugin');
```

The following three examples all work:

Use an already-imported plugin:

```javascript
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero-playground';
import ExecuteJsPlugin from '@ulixee/execute-js-plugin';

const hero = new Hero();
hero.use(ExecuteJsPlugin);
```

Use an NPM package name (if it's publicly available):

```javascript
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero-playground';

const hero = new Hero();
hero.use('@ulixee/execute-js-plugin');
```

Use an absolute path to file that exports one or more plugins:

```javascript
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero-playground';

const hero = new Hero();
hero.use(require.resolve('./CustomPlugins'));
```

### hero.waitForNewTab _()_ {#wait-for-new-tab}

Wait for a new tab to be created. This can occur either via a `window.open` from within the page javascript, or a Link with a target opening in a new tab or window.

#### **Returns**: [`Promise<Tab>`](../advanced-client/tab.md)

```js
const url = 'https://dataliberationfoundation.org/nopost';
const { document, activeTab } = hero;

await hero.goto('http://example.com');

// ...
// <a id="newTabLink" href="/newPage" target="_blank">Link to new target</a>
// ...

await document.querySelector('#newTabLink').click();
const newTab = await hero.waitForNewTab();

await newTab.waitForPaintingStable();
```

# AwaitedDOM

> AwaitedDOM is a NodeJs implementation of W3C's DOM specification that makes it easy to call properties and methods located in a remote browser engine as if they were local to your scraper script context.

AwaitedDOM currently implements a subset of the full DOM specification. Most of the readonly properties and methods have been implemented, however we haven't added DOM manipulation APIs because we believe they are too easy to detect by website bot blockers.

```js
const link = await hero.document.querySelector('a').href;
```

Explore the DOM classes listed on this page to see what has been implemented. You'll find a list of the unimplemented methods and properties located at the bottom of each page.

## Hero DOM Extensions

AwaitedDOM adds several DOM extensions to make Hero easier to use. These extensions are prefixed with the "$" character to keep "non-standard" methods/properties separate from the standard implementation. You can find the [full list here](./awaited-dom-extensions.md).

```js
await hero.querySelector('.element').$click();
```

# Interactions

Every Hero instance has an `interact()` method, which allow you to control the mouse and keyboard. `Interactions` are simple key/value objects you pass into this method:

```js
hero.interact({ move: [100, 356] });
```

Multiple Interactions can be passed through as multiple arguments:

```js
hero.interact({ click: [250, 356] }, { type: 'hello world' });
```

The timing of Interactions are controlled by the [Unblocked Agent](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/agent) and its [Plugins](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/specification), which powers the core browser engine underneath Hero. This allows for realistic-looking, human-like movements on the remote webpage.

Interaction Commands fall into three broad categories:

- Mouse Commands
- Keyboard Commands

## The Six Mouse Commands

- scroll [`MousePosition`](#mouseposition) Scroll page to the desired position.
- move [`MousePosition`](#mouseposition) Move cursor to the desired position.
- click [`MousePosition`](#mouseposition) Press and release the mouse button as a single click.
- clickDown [`MousePosition`](#mouseposition) Press the mouse button.
- clickUp [`MousePosition`](#mouseposition) Release the mouse button.
- doubleclick [`MousePosition`](#mouseposition) Press and release the mouse button twice in rapid succession.

#### **MousePosition**:

Every mouse command include a [`MousePosition`](#mouseposition) value, which specifies where the interaction takes place. It accepts three possible options:

- `[x, y]` These are pixels relative to the top-left corner of the viewport.
- [`SuperElement`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md) Any element from the AwaitedDOM, which are translated into x/y coordinates.
- { element: [`SuperElement`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md), verification: [`ClickVerification`](#clickverification) } An element with a specified click verification strategy.
- `null` Leave the mouse in its current position.

For example, here's how to hover over a link:

```js
const aElem = hero.document.querySelector('a.more-information');
hero.interact({ move: aElem });
```

Or double-click on a specific x/y coordinate:

```js
hero.interact({ doubleclick: [50, 150] });
```

#### **Dictating Left, Middle or Right**:

All button commands (click, doubleclick, etc) operate on the `Left` button by default. However, you can affix any of these commands with `Left`, `Middle` or `Right` to specify a specific button. For example:

```js
hero.interact({ clickRight: [55, 42] });
```

#### **ClickVerification**: {#click-verification}

Click commands can include a click verification when a [`SuperElement`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md) is provided as the `MousePosition`. This is the strategy used to confirm that a specific element is clicked after scrolling and moving the mouse over the target. The default verification is `elementAtPath` if none is provided.

The web has evolved to include sites where "Elements" on some sites are swapped in and out many times as the site is rendered with new data (think React, Vue, Svelte, etc).

During a normal interaction, the [`SuperElement`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md) will be looked up at the beginning of the operation to confirm location and current visibility/clickability. Verification that the given element was actually clicked are:

- `exactElement`. This verification strategy checks that the original node is clicked. This works on most sites, but can fail on dynamic sites, or where data is updating the site (eg, a select list being updated by your type interactions).
- `elementAtPath` Default Option. This verification approach will first check `exactElement`. If the original element is no longer attached or visible, it will re-check the full path to the [`SuperElement`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md) and click on any refreshed node.
- `none`. Do not verify clicks. This approach will scroll and click on the last known position of the element - eg, you ran [`hero.getComputedVisibility *(element)*`](./hero.md#get-computed-visibility) or `element.getBoundingClientRect()`. If the position hasn't been previously looked up, it will be looked up once during the interact command. The position of the element will be used to scroll, move the mouse and click.

Verification strategies can be provided to click/doubleclick commands with a [`SuperElement`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md) as the `MousePosition`. If you don't provide a verification strategy, `elementAtPath` will be used by default.

```js
const aElem = hero.document.querySelector('a.more-information');
hero.interact({ click: { element: aElem, verification: 'exactElement' } });
```

## The Four Keyboard Commands

- keyPress: `KeyboardChar`
- keyDown: `KeyboardChar`
- keyUp: `KeyboardChar`
- type: `(string | KeyboardChar)[]`

Import KeyboardKey from IKeyboardLayoutUS for all valid KeyboardChar values (e.g. `KeyboardKey['\n']`, `KeyboardKey.Enter`).

## Using Shortcuts

If you have no need to change the position of the mouse between commands you can create Interactions using simple `Command` strings.

For example, follow up a move command with click:

```js
hero.interact({ move: [55, 42] }, 'click');
```

## Combining Commands

A single Interaction can include multiple commands. Multiple commands within a single Interaction are executed in rapid succession by the HumanEmulator.

Interactions are similar to paragraphs. The HumanEmulator adds a longer pause between Interactions then it does between commands within a single Interaction.

For example, this allows you to implement simple drag and drop interactions:

```js
hero.interact({ clickDown: [55, 42], move: [155, 142] }, 'clickUp');
```

When multiple commands are combined within a single Interaction, their execution takes the following order:

1. waitForMillis
2. click
3. doubleclick
4. clickDown
5. scroll
6. move
7. clickUp
8. keyPress
9. keyDown
10. type
11. keyUp

Note: Although commands within a single Interaction are sometimes executed at "nearly" the same time, it is never at the same precise moment. Their execution always follows the order listed above.

## When You Shouldn't Combine Commands

It's important to understand that combining multiple commands into a single Interaction usually produces different effects than splitting across multiple Interactions.

For example, there is a subtle but important difference between the following three code blocks:

<label>
  Example #1
</label>

```js
hero.interact({ clickDown: [55, 42] });
```

<label>
  Example #2
</label>

```js
hero.interact({ move: [55, 42], clickDown: [5, 5] });
```

<label>
  Example #2
</label>

```js
hero.interact({ move: [55, 42] }, { clickDown: [5, 5] });
```

The first example moves the cursor to 55x42 before pressing the mouse down.

The second example does the opposite. It presses the mouse down at 5x5 before moving the cursor to 55x42 (see Combining Commands section above).

The third command moves the mouse to 55x42, pauses, then moves the mouse to 5x5 before clicking down.

## Conflicting Commands Will Throw Errors

An error will be thrown if you send commands that conflict with each other.

For example, the following example blows up when doubleclick is called while the mouse is still down:

```js
hero.interact({ clickDown: [55, 42] }, { doubleclick: [5, 5] });
```

You can fix this by releasing the down:

```js
hero.interact({ clickDown: [55, 42] }, 'up', { doubleclick: [5, 5] });
```
# DetachedElement

> DetachedElement is designed for parsing and traversing local HTML fragments without needing a browser engine. It's similar to Cheerio or JSDOM except that it's lighter weight and more W3C compliant.

This library is currently a thin wrapper for [linkedom](https://github.com/WebReflection/linkedom), which Hero uses under the hood when you call [hero.detach(element)](./hero.md#detach) or [element.$detach()](./awaited-dom-extensions.md#detach).
# CookieStorage

The CookieStorage class allows you to get set and remove cookies from the main frame of the current tab. It mimics the W3C Storage api, but has slightly different parameters to deal with cookie settings.

## Constructor

CookieStorage cannot be instantiated. You must retrieve a cookieStorage instance from a [Tab](../advanced-client/tab.md):

```js
const cookieStorage = hero.activeTab.cookieStorage;
```

## Properties

### cookieStorage.length {#length}

Returns the number of cookies for the current tab origin;

#### **Type**: `Promise<number>`

## Methods

### cookieStorage.getItems *()*

Gets all cookies for the current tab origin as `Cookie` objects.

#### `Cookie` properties: {#cookie}
- name `string`. The cookie name.
- value `string`. The cookie value.
- domain `string`. The cookie domain.
- path `string`. The path for the cookie.
- expires `string`. An optional expiration date string.
- httpOnly `boolean`. Whether only accessible via http requests.
- session `boolean`. Whether the cookie should expire after the active session is over.
- secure `boolean`. Whether the cookie should only apply to https secured urls.
- sameSite `Strict | Lax | None`. The same site setting for the cookie.

#### **Returns**: [`Promise<Cookie[]>`](#cookie)

### cookieStorage.getItem *(keyName)*

Gets the cookie with the given `name` equal to `keyName`.

#### **Arguments**:

- keyName `string`. The cookie name to retrieve.

#### **Returns**: [`Promise<Cookie[]>`](#cookie)

### cookieStorage.key *(index)*

Gets the `name` of the cookie with the given `index`. This is a zero-based index. NOTE: key is equivalent to the `name` of a cookie.

#### **Arguments**:

- index `number`. The key index.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<string>`

The function below calls a callback for each cookie key (or name).

```js
function forEachKey(callback) {
  for (var i = 0; i < cookieStorage.length; i++) {
    callback(cookieStorage.key(i));
  }
}
```

### cookieStorage.removeItem *(keyName)*

Removes a cookie with the given `keyName`.

#### **Arguments**:

- keyName `string`. The cookie name.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<boolean>`

### cookieStorage.setItem *(keyName, value, options)*

Sets a cookie for the currently loaded origin.

#### **Arguments**:

# User Agents

> Hero automatically rotates through real UserAgent strings. There's a selector language to indicate your Operating System and Browser version preference.

## Background

User Agent rotation is one of the ways developers have traditionally provided "noise" into the browser fingerprint across a series of scraping sessions. This is still a viable strategy, albeit less and less so as Chrome, Firefox and other browsers have begun to "freeze" the details of the UserAgent in the normal user-agent string (eg: Chrome 105+ no longer includes the build or patch release of the Browser Version, Mac OS 10.15.17 is the maximum Mac Operating System version shared, etc). These browsers have pushed many settings to the `Accept-CH` headers, where details are provided when a website requests them in the first HTTP Document request, or in a first TLS ClientHello message (via ApplicationSettings). All this to say, you now need to align your User Agent across many settings.

## Real User Agent Strings

As the versions of browsers have gotten easier to differentiate, it is also becoming more common for a website to decide you are saying you run a Chrome version, but your features indicate otherwise. For this reason, Hero defaults to round-robining between real UserAgent strings that have been extracted by watching Chrome's auto-update tooling. A user can install multiple browsers:

```bash
yarn add @ulixee/chrome-104-0 @ulixee/chrome-105-0 @ulixee/chrome-106-0
```

When those browsers are installed, they will be automatically added to the round-robin of UserAgents. Whenever a new Hero instance is created, one of the installed Browsers is chosen at random, and a UserAgent string created by the [Unblocked RealUserAgents](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/real-user-agents) project will be selected at random as well. Operating systems are rotated through Mac OS 10.10 to Mac OS 12, and Windows 7-11.

This means anytime you use Hero, you're getting randomized UserAgent strings. The only exception to this is if you load a [UserProfile](../basic-client/hero.md#export-profile), Hero will consistently use the same UserAgent string and Operating system.

## Selecting an Agent

When you initiate a new [Hero](../basic-client/hero.md) instance, one of the constructor options is a `userAgent`. You can provide two options:

1. A full UserAgent string. In this case, Hero will try to load the Browser provided and substitute anything that can't be matched (eg, Linux as an Operating System). If a compatible browser cannot be found, the system will throw an Error to install a matching/compatible browser.
2. A Selector can be provided indicating the version(s) of Chrome you'd like to use, and/or an Operating System. 
 
Selectors are indicated by starting a `userAgent` parameter with a `~`
  - You may limit to a type of browser `~ chrome`
  - You may select an exact browser `~ chrome = 105`
  - You may select a minimum browser version `~ chrome > 105`
  - You may select a range of browser versions `~ chrome >= 105 && chrome <= 106`
  - You may also combine a browser and operating system choice `~ chrome = 105 && mac`
  - You may also combine a browser and operating system version `~ chrome = 105 && mac 10.15`

```js
new Hero({
  userAgent: '~ chrome >= 105 && windows >= 10'
});
const meta = await hero.meta;
console.log(meta.userAgentString); // will be Chrome >= 105 and Windows 10 or 11
// This is the underlying Chrome "executable" version that the UserAgent is emulating. 
// Will usually be same Major version and different Patch version.
console.log(meta.renderingEngineVersion); 
```
# ResourceRequest

> Resource requests are the raw underlying http request details made to access a resource.

Instances of this class are associated with a resource returned from [`tab.waitForResource`](../advanced-client/tab.md##wait-for-resource), listening for resources [`tab.on('resource')`](../advanced-client/tab.md#resource-event) or from the initial window document load.

## Properties

### headers

Retrieve the actual headers sent to the server (order and casing is preserved)

#### **Returns** `{ [name: string]: string }`

### url

The requested url.

#### **Returns** `string`

### timestamp

ISO formatted date string.

#### **Returns** `string`

### method

Http method. Possible values: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE`.

### postData

Data sent to perform this request (if http post)

#### **Returns** `Promise<Buffer>`
# UserProfile

> UserProfiles are "saved state" of a User that can be restored to later resume a session.

UserProfiles enable you to capture the full browser state of a user after performing a series of activities. You might use this to:
 - resume the state of a "logged-in" user
 - accumulate "usage" behavior for an ongoing profile
 - share browser profiles between Hero instances running on different machines

## Constructor

This "state" is not instantiated, but retrieved from an Hero instance: [hero.exportUserProfile()](../basic-client/hero.md#export-profile).

State is stored for all domains (origins) that are loaded into a window at the time of export. The exported state is JSON with additional type information for IndexedDB complex objects.

When you restore a UserProfile, Hero will restore the Cookies, Dom Storage and IndexedDB records for all domains that are included in the state.

```js
await hero.goto('https://dataliberationfoundation.org');
const theStoredProfile = await hero.exportUserProfile();

// ... some time later...

// This browser will be instantiated with all the cookies
// dom storage, etc from the prior session.

const heroWithProfile = new Hero({
  userProfile: theStoredProfile,
});
```

## Properties

### cookies

Cookies for all loaded "origins" for the browsing session.

#### **Type**: [`Cookie[]`](../advanced-client/cookie-storage#cookie)

### deviceProfile

An object containing hardware device properties emulated in this userProfile like memory and gpu information.

#### **Type**: `object`
  - deviceMemory `number`. The amount of memory specified for this machine
  - deviceStorageTib `number`. The amount of storage space in Tebabites for this machine.
  - webGlParameters `object`. Key value of WebGlParameters to override (ie, { 37445: 'WebGl Vendor' })
  - videoDevice `object { deviceId: string, groupId: string }`. A video device to emulate if none is present, such as on a headless server.

### storage

An object with a key for each "security origin" of a page, and value all the associated [DomStorage](#dom-storage).

#### A `DomStorage` object contains: {#dom-storage}
  - localStorage `[key,value][]`. The `window.localStorage` entries for a given domain.
  - sessionStorage `[key,value][]`. The `window.sessionStorage` entries for a given domain.
  - indexedDB `IndexedDB[]`. An array of the `indexedDB` databases for a given domain with records stored as [typeson](https://github.com/dfahlander/typeson).
  
#### **Type**: `object { [origin: string]: DomStorage }`
  - key `string`. The "security origin" of a page or iFrame as defined by Chrome.
  - value [DomStorage](#dom-storage). The `DomStorage` entry for the given origin.

### userAgentString

The user agent used in this profile. Many sites that track user fingerprint information track the useragent information and expect it to remain the same. You can still override this (eg, to update a browser version) by overriding the `userAgent` parameter when constructing a new [`Hero`](../basic-client/hero.md).

#### **Type** string

# DetachedElements

> DetachedElements is a class to retrieve DOM Elements that were saved from a Hero session using [`hero.detach`](../basic-client/hero.md#detach) or [element.$detach](../basic-client/awaited-dom-extensions#detach).

DetachedElements cannot be constructed. You access it through [hero.detachedElements](../basic-client/hero.md#detachedElements) or [heroReplay.detachedElements](../basic-client/hero-replay.md#detachedElements).

Retrieved elements are decendants of the DetachedElement not AwaitedDOM, which means they have no need for promises or awaits.

```js
await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
const h1 = await hero.querySelector('h1').$waitForVisible();
// Extract the DOM Element at this moment in time.
await h1.$extract('title');
// ... do other things
const h1 = await hero.detachedElements.get('title');
// NOTE: synchronous APIs. No longer running in browser.
const text = h1.textContent;
const dataset = h1.dataset;
```

const mainFrame = hero.activeTab.mainFrameEnvironment;
await mainFrame.querySelector('a').$click();
await mainFrame.waitForLocation('change');

const newUrl = await mainFrame.url;
```
# Tab

A Tab is similar to a tab in a consumer browser. Each Tab drives an underlying document with its own page lifecycle and resources. Many of the tab functions are available from the Hero object.

## Constructor

A default tab is provided in each Hero instance. Navigate by using the [hero.goto](../basic-client/hero.md#goto) method.

When a new window is "popped up" (ie, `<a href="/new-place" target="_blank"`), a tab will automatically be associated with the Hero instance. These can be discovered using the [hero.tabs](../basic-client/hero.md#tabs) method, or waiting with [hero.waitForNewTab()](../basic-client/hero.md#wait-for-new-tab).

## Properties

### tab.cookieStorage {#cookie-storage}

Returns a [CookieStorage](../advanced-client/cookie-storage) instance to get/set/delete cookies in the [mainFrameEnvironment](#main-frame-environment) of this tab.

Alias for [tab.mainFrameEnvironment.cookieStorage](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md#cookie-storage).

#### **Type**: [`CookieStorage`](../advanced-client/cookie-storage)

#### **Type**: [`SuperDocument`](../awaited-dom/super-document)

### tab.frameEnvironments {#frame-environments}

Returns a list of [Frames](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md) loaded for this tab.

#### **Type**: [`Promise<Frame[]>`](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md).

### tab.flowCommand *(commandFn, exitState? | options?)* {#flow-command}

A FlowCommand allows you define a "recovery" boundary in the case where an AwaitedDOM error triggers a FlowHandler and modifies your page state. In some cases, you may wish to ensure that a series of commands are re-run instead of a single failing command. For instance, if you lose focus on a modal-window field in the middle of typing, you will want to run the logic that prompted the modal-window to show up.

FlowCommands can define an `exitState`, which will be tested before moving on. An `exitState` is a [`State`](#wait-for-state) object or callback function defined the same as the parameter to [`waitForState`](#wait-for-state). If your function completes and the `exitState` cannot be satisfied, all FlowHandlers will be triggered and the function will try again (up to the `maxRetries` times provided in options).

```js
  await hero.flowCommand(async () => {
    await hero.querySelector('#modalPrompt').$click();
    await hero.querySelector('#field1').$type('text');
  }, assert => {
    assert(hero.querySelector('#field1').value, 'text'); // if false, 1. Prompt FlowHandlers, 2. Retry Command
  });
```

Flow Commands can be nested within each other. If nested commands cannot be completed due to AwaitedDOM errors (interactions, dom errors, dom state timeouts), they will trigger the outer block to be re-tried.

#### **Arguments**:

- commandFn `() => Promise<T>`. Your command function containing one or more Hero commands to retry on AwaitedDOM errors (after resolving one or more FlowHandlers). Any returned value will be returned to the `tab.flowCommand` call.
- exitState `DomState | function(assert: IPageStateAssert): void`. Optional [State](#wait-for-state) object that must resolve before continuing your script execution. If false, FlowHandlers will be retried to determine if another pass should be made.
- options `object`. Optional options to configure this flowCommand. This must be your second argument to `flowCommand`
  - exitState `DomState | function(assert: IPageStateAssert): void`. Optional [State](#wait-for-state) assertion. This parameter is used in place passing a [State](#wait-for-state) directly as a second parameter to `flowCommand`.
  - maxRetries `number`. Default `3`. Optional number of times this FlowCommand should be retried before throwing an error.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<T>`

### tab.focus *()* {#focus}

### tab.getComputedStyle *(element, pseudoElement)* <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#computed-style}

Perform a native `Window.getComputedStyle` request in the current main [FrameEnvironment](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md) - it returns an object containing the values of all CSS properties of an element, after applying active stylesheets and resolving any basic computation those values may contain. Individual CSS property values are accessed through APIs provided by the object, or by indexing with CSS property names.

Alias for [tab.mainFrameEnvironment.getComputedStyle](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md#computed-style).

#### **Arguments**:

- element [`SuperElement`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md) An element loaded in this tab environment.
- pseudoElement `string?` Optional string specifying the pseudo-element to match (eg, ::before, ::after, etc). More information can be found on [w3c](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/).

#### **Returns**: [`Promise<CssStyleDeclaration>`](../awaited-dom/css-style-declaration.md)

```js
await hero.goto('https://dataliberationfoundation.org');
const { document, getComputedStyle } = hero.activeTab;
const selector = document.querySelector('h1');
const style = await getComputedStyle(selector);
const opacity = await style.getProperty('opacity');
```

### tab.getJsValue *(path)* {#get-js-value}

Extract any publicly accessible javascript value from the current main [FrameEnvironment](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md) context.

NOTE: This type of operation could potentially be snooped on by the hosting website as it must run in the main Javascript environment
in order to access variables.

Alias for [tab.mainFrameEnvironment.getJsValue](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md#get-js-value).

#### **Arguments**:

- path `string`

#### **Returns**: `Promise<SerializedValue>`

- layout: width, height, x and y.
- opacity: non-zero opacity.
- css visibility: the element does not have a computed style where visibility=hidden.
- no overlay: no other element which overlays more than one fourth of this element and has at least 1 pixel over the center of the element.
- on the visible screen (not beyond the horizontal or vertical viewport)

Alias for [tab.mainFrameEnvironment.getComputedVisibility](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md#get-computed-visibility).

#### **Arguments**:

- node [`SuperNode`](../awaited-dom/super-node.md). The node to determine visibility.

#### **Returns**: [`SuperNode`](../awaited-dom/super-node.md). A Node that satisfies the given patterns. Evaluates to null if awaited and not present.

### tab.querySelectorAll *(stringOrOptions)* {#query-selector-all}

This is a shortcut for mainFrame.document.querySelectorAll.

#### **Returns**: [`SuperNodeList`](../awaited-dom/super-node-list.md). A NodeList that satisfies the given patterns. Returns an empty list if a resultset is not found that satisfies the constraints.

### tab.registerFlowHandler *(name, state, handlerFn)* {#register-flow-handler}

Register a [FlowHandler](../basic-client/flow-handling.md) on the given tab. A FlowHandler is a callback function that will be invoked anytime your Hero script encounters Awaited Dom errors. These can be used to correct your script flow.

As an example, imagine you are interacting with a website that sometimes pops up an "Accept Cookies" modal. As you don't know "when" it might trigger, it can be difficult to know when to look for the modal. With a FlowHandler, you declare the [State](#wait-for-state) that should trigger the associated callback, and a function to dismiss the cookie popup.

```js
5.   await hero.registerFlowHandler('CookieModal', assert => {
6.     assert(hero.querySelector('#cookie-modal').$isVisible);
7.   },
8.   async error => {
9.     await hero.querySelector('#cookie-modal .dismiss').$click();
10.  });
```

Once registered, your `CookieModal` FlowHandler will be automatically checked anytime an AwaitedDOM error occurs. These errors are things like: an element can't be found, an element interaction failed, or waiting for an element [State](#wait-for-state) timed out.

So, to continue our example, imagine your script is filling out a form field. As you go to click on the field, it can't be clicked because the `CookieModal` has displayed.

```js
5.    await hero.registerFlowHandler('CookieModal',
...
12.   await hero.querySelector('#field1').$click(); // FAILS DUE TO OBSTRUCTION
```

When your script fails to click on `#field1` (line 12 above), the `CookieModal` handler is checked. It matches the current state, and so triggers closing the modal.

```js
9.     await hero.querySelector('#cookie-modal .dismiss').$click(); <--- Closes the modal!
```

Now your script is no longer obstructed and will re-resume clicking on `#field1` (line 12 above).

You might find it useful to continue to accumulate FlowHandlers as you encounter edge cases in your script. In the default case, your individual commands will be retried when a FlowHandler can resolve your page state. In more advanced cases, you might find that you need to resume a "block" of activities. To handle these cases, we have [FlowCommands](#flow-commands).

[FlowCommands](#flow-commands) are simply ways to group a series of commands together. When an AwaitedDOM error occurs, a Flow Command will re-rerun the entire block. In the example above, your interaction might have many steps. You would want to ensure all steps are run when a failure is encountered.

```js
await hero.flowCommand(async () => {
  await hero.querySelector('#field1').$click();
  await hero.querySelector('#field1').$clearInputText();

  // Failure here resumes the entire block once a FlowHandler fixes the state
  await hero.querySelector('#field1').$type('value');
});
```

#### **Arguments**:

- name `string`. A required name to give to this FlowHandler. NOTE: many FlowHandlers trigger on generic querySelector strings (eg, .modal.a1-regEU). Without this self-documenting name, we found them very difficult to decipher after a few weeks passed.
- state `DomState | function(assert: IPageStateAssert): void`. A [State](#wait-for-state) object or callback for the assertion to match.
- handlerFn `() => Promise<any>`. An asynchronous function in which you can resolve the page state to handle this issue.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### tab.reload *(timeoutMs?)* {#reload}

Reload the currently loaded url.

#### **Arguments**:

- timeoutMs `number`. Optional timeout milliseconds. Default `30,000`. A value of `0` will never timeout.

#### **Returns**: [`Promise<Resource>`](../advanced-client/resource.md) The loaded resource representing this page.

### tab.takeScreenshot *(options?)* {#take-screenshot}

Takes a screenshot of the current contents rendered in the browser.

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object` Optional
  - format `jpeg | png`. Image format type to create. Default `jpeg`.
  - jpegQuality `number`. Optional compression quality from 1 to 100 for jpeg images (100 is highest quality).
  - rectangle `IRect`. Optionally clip the screenshot to the given rectangle (eg, x, y, width, height). Includes a pixel scale.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<Buffer>` Buffer with image bytes in base64.

### tab.triggerFlowHandlers *()* {#trigger-flow-handler}

Check the state of all [FlowHandlers](#register-flow-handler) and trigger the first one that matches the current page state. Returns the name of the triggered FlowHandler (if one was triggered), and returns the names of all FlowHandler who's state match the current page state.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<{triggeredFlowHandler?: string; matchedFlowHandlers: string[]}>`

### tab.validateState *(state)* {#validate-state}

Check a [State](#wait-for-state) defined as per `tab.waitForState` above. Instead of waiting, this method will check the state a single time and return a boolean if the state is valid.

#### **Arguments**:

- state `object` | `(assert: IPageStateAssert) => void`. A state object or just the callback directly as a shorter option.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<boolean>`

### tab.waitForElement *(element,options)* {#wait-for-element}

Wait until a specific element is present in the dom of the [mainFrameEnvironment](#main-frame-environment).

Alias for [tab.mainFrameEnvironment.waitForElement](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md#wait-for-element.md).

#### **Arguments**:

- element [`SuperElement`](../awaited-dom/super-element.md)
- options `object` Accepts any of the following:
  - timeoutMs `number`. Timeout in milliseconds. Default `30,000`.
  - waitForVisible `boolean`. Wait until this element is visible to a user (see [getComputedVisibility](#get-computed-visibility).
  - waitForHidden `boolean`. Wait until this element is hidden to a user (see [getComputedVisibility](#get-computed-visibility).
  - waitForClickable `boolean`. Wait until this element is visible to a user, int the viewport, and unobstructed (see [getComputedVisibility](#get-computed-visibility).

#### **Returns**: `Promise`

### tab.waitForPaintingStable *(options)* {#wait-for-painting-stable}

Wait for the [mainFrameEnvironment](#main-frame-environment) to be loaded such that a user can see the main content above the fold, including on javascript-rendered pages (eg, Single Page Apps). This load event works around deficiencies in using the Document "load" event, which does not always trigger, and doesn't work for Single Page Apps.

Alias for [tab.mainFrameEnvironment.waitForPaintingStable](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md#wait-for-painting-stable).

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object` Optional
  - timeoutMs `number`. Timeout in milliseconds. Default `30,000`.
  - sinceCommandId `number`. A `commandId` from which to look for load status changes.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

If at the moment of calling this method, the selector already exists, the method will return immediately.

```js
const { activeTab, document } = hero;

const elem = document.querySelector('a.visible');
await activeTab.waitForElement(elem, {
  waitForVisible: true,
});
```

### tab.waitForState *(state, options)* {#wait-for-state}

Wait for a state to be loaded based on a series of conditions. This feature allows you to detect when many different conditions all resolve to true.

Hero normally operates by running each command in order. This makes it a challenge to check for many possible states concurrently. `waitForState` runs the underlying commands for state assertions in one round-trip to Chrome.

Each `assertion` function takes in a state "Promise" and will call the provided "assertion" callback function each time new state is available. Each assertionCallbackFn simply returns true/false if it's given a valid state.

NOTE: Null access exceptions are ignored, so you don't need to worry about individual assertion data being present in the assertion callbacks.

```js
await hero.waitForState({
  all(assert) {
    assert(hero.url, url => url === 'https://ulixee.org'); // once the url is resolved, it will be checked against https://ulixee.org
    assert(hero.isPaintingStable); // the default function evaluates if the result is true
  },
});

await hero.goto('https://dataliberationfoundation.org');

await hero.waitForState({
  all(assert) {
    assert(hero.url, 'https://dataliberationfoundation.org'); // a value will be tested for equality
    assert(hero.isPaintingStable);
    assert(
      hero.document.querySelector('h1').textContent,
      text => text === "It's Time to Open the Data Economy",
    );
  },
});
```

WaitForState can be optionally shortened to the callback:

```js
await hero.waitForState(assert => {
  assert(hero.url, 'https://dataliberationfoundation.org'); // a value will be tested for equality
  assert(hero.isPaintingStable);
  assert(
    hero.document.querySelector('h1').textContent,
    text => text === "It's Time to Open the Data Economy",
  );
});
```

#### **Arguments**:

- state `object` | `function(assert: IPageStateAssert): void`. A state object or just the callback directly as a shorter option.
  - url? `string` | `Regexp`. Optional url to run this state on (useful for running in a loop)
  - all `function(assert: IPageStateAssert): void`. A synchronous function that will be true if all assertions evaluate to true.
    - assert `function(statePromise: Promise<T>, assertionValueOrCallbackFn: (function(result: T): boolean)): void`. A function that takes a Promise as a first parameter, and a callback that will be checked when new state is available.
      - statePromise `PromiseLike<T>` A Hero Promise that issues a command against this tab (url, isPaintingStable, domElement, isVisible, etc).
      - assertionValueOrCallbackFn `value: T | function(state: T): boolean`. A function that will receive updated state as it becomes available. You should synchronously evaluate to true/false. If this parameter is a non-function, it will be compared for equality.
- options `object` Optional
  - timeoutMs `number`. Timeout in milliseconds. Default `30,000`.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### tab.waitForFileChooser *(options)* {#wait-for-file-chooser}

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object` Optional
  - timeoutMs `number`. Timeout in milliseconds. Default `30,000`.
  - sinceCommandId `number`. A `commandId` from which to look for load status changes. Default is to look back to the command preceding this command (eg, a click or interact event).

#### **Returns**: [`Promise<FileChooser>`](../advanced-client/file-chooser)

### tab.waitForLoad *(status, options)* {#wait-for-load}

Wait for the load status of the [mainFrameEnvironment](#main-frame-environment).

Alias for [tab.mainFrameEnvironment.waitForLoad](../advanced-client/frame-environment.md#wait-for-load).

#### **Arguments**:

- status `NavigationRequested | HttpRequested | HttpResponsed | HttpRedirected | DomContentLoaded | PaintingStable` The load status event to wait for.
- options `object`
  - timeoutMs `number`. Timeout in milliseconds. Default `30,000`.
  - sinceCommandId `number`. A `commandId` from which to look for status changed.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

The following are possible statuses and their meanings:

# DetachedResources

> DetachedResources is a class to retrieve Hero Resources saved for extraction. They include all network assets loaded to render a page, including CSS, Javascript, Fonts, Web Sockets, XHR/Fetch Requests, and more.

Hero [Resources](../advanced-client/resource.md) represent resources used to render a Page, including the HTTP Requests to retrieve them.

Examples of this include JSON files, HTML Documents, PDFs, etc.

Saving them for extraction can be desirable because you can reload them into a [HeroReplay](../basic-client/hero-replay.md) instance repeatedly without having to restart a Headless browser (which can be significantly slower). Once they're saved, you can rapidly iterate on your extraction logic (eg, to transform a JSON payload) until it produces the desired output.

```js
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero-playground';

async function run() {
  const hero = new Hero();
  await hero.activeTab.on('resource', async resource => {
    if (resource.type === 'XHR') {
      await resource.$extractLater('xhr');
    }
  });
  await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
  await hero.waitForPaintingStable();
}

async function replay(sessionId) {
  const heroReplay = new HeroReplay(sessionId);
  const xhrs = await heroReplay.detachedResources.getAll('xhr');
  const gridsomeData = [];
  for (const xhr of xhrs) {
    // NOTE: synchronous APIs.
    const jsonObject = xhr.json;
    if (xhr.json?.data) {
      gridsomeData.push(xhr.json.data);
    }
  }
}
```

# ConnectionToHeroCore

> ConnectionToHeroCore is a built-in mechanism to stream commands to local and remote instances of Hero using the same simple interface.

When you install Hero, it comes ready to run locally with a Chrome engine and client all in your local codebase. However, as you begin to scale the number of concurrent scrapes, you will end up needing to manage a fleet of "engines" running on a number of computers.

```javascript
const { Hero: BaseHero } = require('@ulixee/hero');
const { Hero: PlaygroundHero } = require('@ulixee/hero-playground');

(async () => {
  // starts a Hero Core and automatically connects
  const local = new PlaygroundHero();
  // dials a Remote Core
  const remote = new BaseHero({
    ConnectionToHeroCore: ConnectionToHeroCore.remote('192.168.1.1:3444'),
  });
})().catch(console.log);
```

Connections take "transports" that allow it to run over different types of connections and protocols. Hero uses WebSockets as the default transport (`WsTransportToCore`). Find more details [here](../advanced-concepts/client-vs-core.md).

### Configuration {#configuration}

When you provide a ConnectionToHeroCore to a [Hero](../basic-client/hero.md) instance, Hero will accept either an `options` object or a `ConnectionToHeroCore` instance.

### Options {#options}

The provided settings configure the connection to `Core`. Note: some configurations will apply to all connected Heroes ( `dataDir`).

- options `IConnectionToCoreOptions`. A set of settings that controls the creation of a "connection" to a `Hero Core`.
  - host `string`. An optional `hostname:port` url that will be used to establish a WebSocket Transport to a Hero Core running on another machine. If no host is provided, a connection to a "locally" running `Core` will be attempted.
  - maxConcurrency `number`. The max number of Heroes to allow to be created at the same time. Heroes are "active" until the created Hero is closed. If not provided, this number will match the max allowed by a `Core`.
  - instanceTimeoutMillis `number`. The number of milliseconds to give each Hero in this connection to complete a session. A TimeoutError will be thrown if this time is exceeded.
  - dataDir `string` defaults to `os.tmpdir()/.ulixee`. Directory to store session files and mitm certificates.
- connection `ConnectionToHeroCore`. A pre-initialized connection to a `Hero Core`. You can use this option to pre-check your connection to a remote connection, or to provide customization to the connection.

## Methods

### connection.connect _()_ {#connect}

Initializes the connection to the specified core. You can use this function if you would like to pre-connect to your remote host and ensure connections are properly established before continuing.

NOTE: this will be automatically called when you pass in a connection to Hero.

#### **Returns**: `Promise`

### connection.disconnect _()_ {#disconnect}

Closes the connection and stops all pending requests.

#### **Returns**: `Promise`
# FileChooser

> FileChoosers represent a prompt to input one or more file.

The FileChooser class is initiated by clicking on a file input. This class will be return by calling [`tab.waitForFileChooser`](../advanced-client/tab.md#wait-for-file-chooser).

## Properties

### inputElement

The element that was clicked on to initiate this prompt.

#### **Returns** `HTMLInputElement`

### acceptsMultipleFiles

If multiple files are supported.

#### **Returns** `boolean`

## Methods

### chooseFiles<em>(file[, ...files])</em>

Supply one or more files to set on this input. Mimetype will be inferred from the provided files.

#### **Arguments**:

One or more `File` arguments.

   - data `Buffer`. File contents as a Node.js Buffer.
   - name `string`. The filename to use for this file.

#### **Returns** `Promise<void>`
# EventTarget

> An EventTarget is a listener similar in design to EventListener in nodejs.

EventTarget adds `on` and `off` functions to a normal document EventTarget.
# WebsocketResource

> Websocket Resources are core websocket connections between a client and server.

Instances of this class are associated with a resource returned from [`tab.waitForResource`](../advanced-client/tab.md##wait-for-resource), listening for resources [`tab.on('resource')`](../advanced-client/tab.md#resource-event) or from the initial window document load. It contains all properties of a `Resource` in addition to an ability to subscribe to messages sent back and forth.

# Deployment

Hero's architecture is split into two processes: a Client and a Core. It's recommended that you read [client vs core](./client-vs-core.md) to understand the difference.

When you start to think about deploying Hero onto a server, you have a few options:

## Launch a Ulixee Cloud

The easiest solution is to use the `@ulixee/cloud` package. See details of the Ulixee Cloud [here](https://ulixee.org/docs/cloud).

You can either launch our pre-built [docker](https://github.com/ulixee/ulixee/tree/main/cloud/tools/docker) image, or start Ulixee Cloud via a simple script. Make sure to open the port you allocate on any firewall that a client might have to pass through:

```javascript
const { CloudNode } = require('@ulixee/cloud');

(async () => {
  const cloudNode = new CloudNode();
  await cloudNode.listen({ port: 7007 });
})();
```

### Setting Up the Client

Your [Hero](../basic-client/hero.md) instance must be configured to point at this Remote Core (and any others you've set up).

NOTE: you can use the `@ulixee/hero` npm package if you don't want to install a full browser engine on the machine coordinating all your scrapes. That example is shown below.

```javascript
const Hero = require('@ulixee/hero');

(async () => {
  const hero = new Hero({
    connectionToCore: {
      host: `${SERVERIP}:7007`,
    },
  });

  await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
})().catch(console.log);
```

## Fullstack

If you want to run Hero all in one process, you'll want to run a fullstack deployment. Make sure you add both client and core to your project.

```bash
yarn add @ulixee/hero @ulixee/hero-core
```

To connect your client and core, you'll create a transport bridge that will pipe commands back and forth.

```javascript
import HeroCore from '@ulixee/hero-core';
import TransportBridge from '@ulixee/net/lib/TransportBridge';
import { ConnectionToHeroCore } from '@ulixee/hero';

const bridge = new TransportBridge();
const connectionToCore = new ConnectionToHeroCore(bridge.transportToCore);

const heroCore = new HeroCore();
heroCore.addConnection(bridge.transportToClient);

async function main() {
  // hero will connect directly
  const hero = new Hero({ connectionToCore });
  await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
}
```

## Integrate with a node Http(s) Server

If you have an existing HTTP server and you want to run your client code separately, you can integrate with an Http/Https server (eg, you might do this to load balance a large volume of scrapes).

Add `@ulixee/hero-core` and `@ulixee/net` to your server project:

```bash
yarn add @ulixee/hero-core @ulixee/net
```

```js
import HeroCore from '@ulixee/hero-core';
import WsTransportToClient from '@ulixee/net/lib/WsTransportToClient';
import * as WebSocket from 'ws';
import * as http from 'http';
import * as https from 'https';

const heroCore = new HeroCore();

// Attach Hero to your Http or Https Server
async function bindHeroCore(yourHttpServer: http.Server | https.Server) {
  
  const wsServer = new WebSocket.Server({
    server: yourHttpServer,
  });
  wsServer.on('connection', (ws, req) => {
    // OPTIONAl: it's configured to listen on a path
    if (req.url.startsWith('/hero')) {
      const transport = new WsTransportToClient(ws, req);
      heroCore.addConnection(transport);
    }
  });
}
```

Add `@ulixee/hero` to your client project:

```bash
yarn add @ulixee/hero
```

```js
// Connect to your server IP and port as configured above
async function runHero(serverIpAndPort: string) {
  // hero will dial your IP:PORT/<OPTIONAL PATH>
  const hero = new Hero({ connectionToCore: { host: `${serverIpAndPort}/hero` } });
  await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
}
```

NOTE: If you don't have an existing Http server, a normal NodeJs server will suffice.

```js
import * as http from 'http';

const server = new http.Server();
await new Promise(resolve => server.listen(8080, resolve));
```
# TimeTravel

> TimeTravel lets you replay every click, key press, mouse movement and dom change from your session in high fidelity.

#### High Fidelity

Everytime you create a new [Hero](../basic-client/hero.md), a [Session](./sessions.md) records every DOM change, click, mouse movement, "value" change for elements, Shadow DOM changes, IFrame updates, and everything else we can measure on the page. 

TimeTravel "reconstructs" your page using all these events from every single micro-tick that occurred during your scrape.

#### Devtools At Any Point in Your Script

You get at a scrubber to move back and forth in your session, and you can use a DevTools javascript console to run selectors at any point in the script. This can help to identify those troublesome popups that run only every 10th run of your scrape.

#### Offline

TimeTravel operates by replaying recorded assets and changes. It does not require any connection to the original website, so you can try things out without any impact to the end site.
# Client vs. Core

Hero's architecture is split into two processes: a Client and a Core. The Client is what your script interacts with; Core is what does most of the heavy lifting. WebSockets is the default mechanism for communicating between these two processes. Most users have no need to know anything about Core since Hero simpliy works out of the box.

However, this division of process allows for some interesting advanced configurations. For example, you can run a single lightweight Client on one lightweight machine with multiple Cores running on separate heavier-duty machines.

## Setting Up a Server Process for Core

The `@ulixee/hero-core` package contains all the logic for running Core, but it has no network connectivity. The easiest solution is to use the `@ulixee/cloud` package. See details of the Ulixee Cloud [here](https://ulixee.org/docs/cloud).

Various other strategies are listed [here](./deployment.md).
# Sessions

> A Session tracks and coordinates a single "scraping" session. It manages the fingerprints, browser settings, and plugins that [Hero](../basic-client/hero.md) uses.

Hero's session logic is managed in the [Core](./client-vs-core.md), with only a minimal amount of session data exposed in the Client. All session data is stored in a Sqlite database using a module called SessionState. This database tracks all the information needed for many of Hero's advanced features, such as [TimeTravel](./time-travel.md).

### Default Database Location

By default, session databases are located in `os.tmpdir()\.ulixee`. Tmpdir refers to the NodeJs function in the [OS module](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_tmpdir).

You can control the location sessions are stored using the [`dataDir`](../overview/configuration.md#data-dir) configuration when starting a Core.

To output your tmpdir, you can run:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('os').tmpdir())"
```

### Managing Sessions

Session databases can grow rather large, since they store all DOM changes, Devtools messages and Http resources for all loaded tabs and frames in a "scraping session".

You should clean up any unwanted or unneeded session databases manually. You can safely discard any databases you do not want to inspect at any future point, or you can archive them to another location. Either approach will not impact future scripts. An archived or relocated Session database can still be replayed at a later date. 

You can subscribe to closed Session databases for automated cleanup (this will run wherever your Core is running).

```js
import { Session } from '@ulixee/hero-core';
import * as Fs from 'fs'

Session.events.on('closed', ({ id, databasePath }) => {
  // NOTE: determine if database should be kept (track session ids vs errors on your own)
  if (!didHaveErrors(id)) {
    Fs.unlink(databasePath);
  }
});
```
# Client Plugins

> Client plugins extend Hero's frontend functionality at the Client interface level. YOu can use them to add extra properties and methods to the hero and/or tab instances.

## Creating Your Own Client Plugin

Adding a new plugin is as simple as creating a javascript class with the correct properties and methods, then registering it with `hero.use()`.

We recommend using the ClientPlugin base class in @ulixee/hero-plugin-utils, which handles setting most of the required properties and methods, everything except the static `id` property. Here's a simple plugin that adds a single hello() method to hero: 

```javascript
import { ClientPlugin } from '@ulixee/hero-plugin-utils';

export default class ClientHelloPlugin extends ClientPlugin {
  static readonly id = 'client-hello-plugin';
  // static type handled by ClientPlugin base

  onHero(hero) {
    hero.hello = (name) => console.log(`Hello ${name}`));
  } 
}
```

To register this ClientHelloPlugin in Hero, just pass it to `hero.use()`:

```javascript
import hero from '@ulixee/hero';
import ClientHelloPlugin from './ClientHelloPlugin';

hero.use(ClientHelloPlugin);
```

Your hero instance now supports the hello() method:

```javascript
hero.hello('World');
```

The rest of this page documents the various functionalities you can add to your class.

## Constructor

### new ClientPlugin<em>()</em>
A new instance of ClientPlugin is created for every hero instance. Use a constructor if you want to hook into the plugin's initialization. The constructor receives no arguments.

## Class Properties

### ClientPlugin.id *required*
This must be unique across all your Hero client plugins. We recommend using your plugin's npm package name.
#### **Type**: `string`

```javascript
import pkg from './package.json';

export default ClientHelloPlugin extends ClientPlugin {
  static readonly id = pkg.name;
  // static type handled by ClientPlugin base
}
```

### ClientPlugin.type *required*
This must always be set to `'ClientPlugin'`. It's how Hero differentiates between different plugin types. If your class extended the ClientPlugin base in @ulixee/utils then this is already set.
#### **Type**: `string` This must always be set to `'ClientPlugin'`.

### ClientPlugin.coreDependencyIds *optional*
Use this property to specify a list of core pluginIds that your ClientPlugin needs to operate. You should keep this list to the absolute minimum required.
#### **Type**: `string[]`

## Instance Method Hooks
The following methods are all optional. Use them when you want to hook into a specific Hero flow:

### onHero<em>(hero, sendToCore)</em> *optional*
This method is called every time a new Hero is initialized.
#### **Arguments**:
- hero `Hero`
- sendToCore: `(toPluginId: string, ...args: any[]) => Promise<any>`
#### **Returns** `void`

### onTab<em>(hero, tab, sendToCore)</em> *optional*
This method is called every time a new Tab is initialized.
#### **Arguments**:
- hero `Hero`
- tab `Tab`
- sendToCore: `(toPluginId: string, ...args: any[]) => Promise<any>`
#### **Returns** `void`

### onFrameEnvironment<em>(hero, frameEnvironment, sendToCore)</em> *optional*
This method is called every time a new FrameEnvironment is initialized.
#### **Arguments**:
- hero `Hero`
- tab `FrameEnvironment`
- sendToCore: `(toPluginId: string, ...args: any[]) => Promise<any>`
#### **Returns** `void`
# Core Plugins

> Core plugins extend Hero's backend functionality at the Core level. These plugins have full control over TCP fingerprinting, header order, HTML rendering, audio codecs and thousands of other variables that allow undetectable emulation of any browser you desire.

## Creating Your Own Core Plugin

Adding a new plugin is as simple as creating a javascript class with the correct properties and methods, then registering it with `hero.use()`.

We recommend using the CorePlugin base class provided by `@ulixee/hero-plugin-utils`, which handles setting most of the required properties and methods, everything except the static `id` property. Here's a simple plugin that adds a single hello() method to hero, which outputs to the browser's console.

```javascript
import { ClientPlugin, CorePlugin } from '@ulixee/hero-plugin-utils';

export class ClientHelloPlugin extends ClientPlugin {
  static readonly id = 'hello-plugin';

  onHero(hero, sendToCore) {
    hero.hello = async (name) => await sendToCore('hello-plugin', name);  
  } 
}

export class CoreHelloPlugin extends CorePlugin {
  static readonly id = 'hello-plugin';

  onClientCommand({ page }, name) {
    `Hello ${name}`);
  }
}
```

As shown above, you can export multiple plugins from the same file. Also a client/core plugin combination can share the same `id` (unlike two core plugins, which must each have unique ids).

To register this plugin in Hero, just pass it to `hero.use()`. In the following example we pass through a path to the plugin file instead of the plugin class itself -- we're doing this because by default Core runs in a separate process from Client.

```javascript
import hero from '@ulixee/hero';

hero.use(require.resolve('./HelloPlugin'));

await hero.hello('World');
```

NOTE: you can also register a plugin "directly" in Hero-Core. You do need to understand the [Client vs Core](../advanced-concepts/client-vs-core.md) separation. Wherever your `Core` process is going to be initialized, you can add code to tap into `@ulixee/hero-core`.

```javascript
import HeroCore from '@ulixee/hero-core';
import CorePlugin from './HelloPlugin'

// run before main code (or during initialization)
HeroCore.use(CorePlugin);

(function main() { // your code here
```

The rest of this page documents the various functionalities you can add to your class.

## Constructor

### new CorePlugin<em>(createOptions)</em>

New instance of CorePlugin is created for every hero instance. The createOptions object has three properties.

#### **Arguments**:

- createOptions `object` Receives the following:
  - userAgentOption `UserAgentOption`. An object containing various attributes of the chosen userAgent (name, version, etc).
  - browserEngine `BrowserEngine`. An instance containing the current BrowserEngine.
  - plugins `Plugins`. An instance containing the current instance of Plugins attached to this session.
  - logger `BoundLog`. An instance of logger you can use to log output.

## Class Properties

### CorePlugin.id _required_

This should usually be set to the plugin's npm package name.

#### **Type**: `string`

### CorePlugin.type _required_

This tells Hero that the plugin is a CorePlugin. It must always be set.

#### **Type**: `string`. This must always be set to `'CorePlugin'`.

## Instance Method Hooks

The following methods are optional. Add them to your plugin as needed. 

NOTE: Many of these API calls allow you to tap into the underlying [Unblocked Plugin](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/plugins) Specification ([spec](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/specification)). You can find detailed documentation in the two projects listed above.

### configure<em>(config)</em>

This hook is called during the initialization of a session/browserEmulator.

#### **Arguments**:

- config `object` Receives any (or none) of the following:
  - viewport `Viewport`. This is an object containing browser width and height as well as screenWidth and screenHeight, among other properties.
  - geolocation `Geolocation`. This is an object containing longtitude and latitude, among other properties.
  - timezoneId `string`. The configured unicode TimezoneId or host default (eg, America/New_York).
  - locale `string`. The configured locale in use (eg, en-US).
  - upstreamProxyUrl `string`. A socks5 or http proxy url (and optional auth) to use for all HTTP requests in this session. See Hero constructor for details.
  - upstreamProxyUseSystemDns `boolean`. A variable to indicate DNS should be resolved on the host machine. By default, if a proxy is used, hosts will be resolved by the remote proxy.
  - upstreamProxyIpMask `object`. Optional settings to mask the Public IP Address of a host machine when using a proxy. See Hero constructor for details.
  - dnsOverTlsProvider `object`. Configure the host and port to use for DNS over TLS. See Hero constructor for details.

Modify any value in the object to change it session-wide.

#### **Returns** `void`

### onNewBrowser<em>(browser, launchArgs)</em> *optional*

This is called every time a new browser engine is started, which may not be every session. A Core Plugin can add to the launch arguments that will sent to the process creation of the browser:
- For Chrome, a list can be found [here](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/)

#### **Arguments**:

- browser `IBrowser`. The Agent browser. Arguments can be manipulated on the `engine.launchArguments` property.
- userConfig `IBrowserUserConfig`. Additional options provided to launch this instance.
  - showChrome: `boolean` - has the user requested to show the browser
  - disableGpu: `boolean` - has the user requested to disable the gpu
  - showDevtools: `boolean` - has the user requested to automatically show devtools

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### onClientCommand<em>(meta, ...args)</em> _optional_

This method is called every time a ClientPlugin calls sendToCore to this plugin's ID.

#### **Arguments**:

- meta `OnClientCommandMeta`. 
  - page `IPage`. The given Unblocked Agent `Page`.
  - frame `IFrame`. The given Unblocked Agent `Frame` if applicable.
- args: `any[]`. Whatever args the ClientPlugin passed through sendToCore.

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### onDnsConfiguration<em>(settings: IDnsSettings)</em>

Configures the DNS over TLS connection that Chrome defaults to using if your DNS provider supports it.

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### onTcpConfiguration<em>(settings: ITcpSettings)</em>

Some Tcp settings vary based on the Operating System making http requests.
Current supports:

- `windowSize`
- `ttl`

Alter the object's values to change session-wide.

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### onTlsConfiguration<em>(settings: ITlsSettings)</em>

Emulate the ClientHello signature, which can vary between browser versions

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### onHttp2SessionConnect<em>(request: IHttpResourceLoadDetails, settings: IHttp2ConnectSettings)</em>

A callback is provided for each HTTP2 Session that is created allowing you to customize the initial SETTINGS and WINDOW_UPDATE frames.

Current Supports
- `settings`. Http2RequestSettings using keys from Node.js settings (https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html#http2_settings_object)
- `localWindowSize`. A value to trigger a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with the initial connect.

Alter the object's values per Http2 Session.

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### beforeHttpRequest<em>(request: IHttpResourceLoadDetails)</em>

A callback is provided for each HTTP request where you are given the opportunity to re-order, re-case, and add or remove headers so that they resemble real browser requests. Headless Chrome is known to provide headers is different order on occasion from headed. See [https://github.com/ulixee/double-agent](https://github.com/ulixee/double-agent) for details.

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### beforeHttpResponse<em>(resource: IHttpResourceLoadDetails)</em>

Callbacks on each cookie set, and to return the valid list of cookies. This callback can be used to simulate cookie behavior that varies from the underlying browser - for instance Safari 13.

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### onNewPage<em>(page: IPage)</em>

This is called every time a new page/iframe is loaded. Use this hook to modify the DOM environment (i.e., to emulate various browser features) before a website loads.

#### **Returns** `Promise`

### onNewWorker<em>(worker: IWorker)</em>

This is called every time a new worker is loaded within a page. Use this hook to modify the DOM environment (i.e., to emulate various browser features) before a website loads.

#### **Returns** `Promise`

### websiteHasFirstPartyInteraction<em>(url: URL)</em>

Callback to indicate a domain has "first-party" interaction. Some browsers, like Safari 13.1, started granting cookie storage to websites only after a user has directly interacted with them.

#### **Returns** `Promise` | `void`

### playInteractions<em>(interactions, runFn, helper)</em>

Use this method if you want to change the speed or randomness of user Interactions (mouse movements, typing, etc).

#### **Returns** `Promise`

### adjustStartingMousePoint<em>(point, helper)</em>

This is used within Core to start the mouse Interactions correctly.

#### **Returns** `Promise`

# [AwaitedDOM](../basic-client/awaited-dom) <span>/</span> SuperText

<div class='overview'><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>Text</code></strong> interface represents the textual content of <code>Element</code> or <code>Attr</code>. </span></div>

<div class='overview'>If an element has no markup within its content, it has a single child implementing <code>Text</code> that contains the element's text. However, if the element contains markup, it is parsed into information items and <code>Text</code> nodes that form its children.</div>

<div class='overview'>New documents have a single <code>Text</code> node for each block of text. Over time, more <code>Text</code> nodes may be created as the document's content changes. The <code>Node.normalize()</code> method merges adjacent <code>Text</code> objects back into a single node for each block of text.</div>

## Dependencies


SuperText implements all the properties and methods of the following classes:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| [CDATASection](./cdata-section.md) | [CharacterData](./character-data.md) |
| [EventTarget](./event-target.md) | [Node](./node.md) |
| [Text](./text.md) |  |
# [AwaitedDOM](../basic-client/awaited-dom) <span>/</span> CharacterData

<div class='overview'>The <code><strong>CharacterData</strong></code> abstract interface represents a <code>Node</code> object that contains characters. This is an abstract interface, meaning there aren't any object of type <code>CharacterData</code>: it is implemented by other interfaces, like <code>Text</code>, <code>Comment</code>, or <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> which aren't abstract.</div>

## Properties

### .data <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#data}

# [AwaitedDOM](../basic-client/awaited-dom) <span>/</span> HTMLScriptElement

<div class='overview'><span class="seoSummary">HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements expose the <strong><code>HTMLScriptElement</code></strong> interface, which provides special properties and methods for manipulating the behavior and execution of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements (beyond the inherited <code>HTMLElement</code> interface).</span></div>

<div class='overview'>JavaScript files should be served with the <code>application/javascript</code> MIME type, but browsers are lenient and block them only if the script is served with an image type (<code>image/*</code>), video type (<code>video/*</code>), audio type (<code>audio/*</code>), or <code>text/csv</code>. If the script is blocked, its element receives an <code>error</code> event; otherwise, it receives a <code>load</code> event.</div>

## Properties

### elem.async <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#async}

<p>The <code>async</code> and <code>defer</code> attributes are boolean attributes that control how the script should be executed. <strong>The <code>defer</code> and <code>async</code> attributes must not be specified if the <code>src</code> attribute is absent.</strong></p>
    <p>There are three possible execution modes:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>If the <code>async</code> attribute is present, then the script will be executed asynchronously as soon as it downloads.</li>
     <li>If the <code>async</code> attribute is absent but the <code>defer</code> attribute is present, then the script is executed when the page has finished parsing.</li>
     <li>If neither attribute is present, then the script is fetched and executed immediately, blocking further parsing of the page.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The <code>defer</code> attribute may be specified with the <code>async</code> attribute, so legacy browsers that only support <code>defer</code> (and not <code>async</code>) fall back to the <code>defer</code> behavior instead of the default blocking behavior.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The exact processing details for these attributes are complex, involving many different aspects of HTML, and therefore are scattered throughout the specification. <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/scripting-1.html#prepare-a-script" rel="noopener">These algorithms</a> describe the core ideas, but they rely on the parsing rules for <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>&nbsp;<a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#scriptTag" rel="noopener">start</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#scriptEndTag" rel="noopener">end</a> tags in HTML, <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#scriptForeignEndTag" rel="noopener">in foreign content</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/the-xhtml-syntax.html#scriptTagXML" rel="noopener">in XML</a>; the rules for the <code>document.write()</code> method; the handling of <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/webappapis.html#scripting" rel="noopener">scripting</a>; and so on.</div>

# [AwaitedDOM](../basic-client/awaited-dom) <span>/</span> Attr

<div class='overview'>The <code><strong>Attr</strong></code> interface represents one of a DOM element's attributes as an object. In most DOM methods, you will directly retrieve the attribute as a string (e.g., <code>Element.getAttribute()</code>), but certain functions (e.g., <code>Element.getAttributeNode()</code>) or means of iterating return <code>Attr</code> types.</div>

## Properties

### .localName <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#localName}

 <div class="note">
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> DOM Level 4 removed this property. The assumption was that since you get an <code>Attr</code> object from an <code>Element</code>, you should already know the associated element.<br>
  As that doesn't hold true in cases like <code>Attr</code> objects being returned by <code>Document.evaluate</code>, the DOM Living Standard reintroduced the property.</p>
 <p>Gecko outputs a deprecation note starting from Gecko 7.0 (Firefox 7.0 / Thunderbird 7.0 / SeaMonkey 2.4). This note was removed again in Gecko 49.0 (Firefox 49.0 / Thunderbird 49.0 / SeaMonkey 2.46).</p>

# [AwaitedDOM](../basic-client/awaited-dom) <span>/</span> CSSStyleSheet

<div class='overview'><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>CSSStyleSheet</code></strong> interface represents a single CSS stylesheet, and lets you inspect and modify the list of rules contained in the stylesheet.</span> It inherits properties and methods from its parent, <code>StyleSheet</code>.</div>

<div class='overview'>A stylesheet consists of a collection of <code>CSSRule</code> objects representing each of the rules in the stylesheet. The rules are contained in a <code>CSSRuleList</code>, which can be obtained from the stylesheet's <code>cssRules</code> property.</div>

<div class='overview'>For example, one rule might be a <code>CSSStyleRule</code> object containing a style such as:</div>

## Properties

### .cssRules <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#cssRules}


 <p>Returns a live <code>CSSRuleList</code> which maintains an up-to-date list of the <code>CSSRule</code> objects that comprise the stylesheet.</p>
 <p>This is normally used to access individual rules like this:</p>
 <pre><code>styleSheet.cssRules[i] // where i = 0..cssRules.length-1</code></pre>
 <p>To add or remove items in <code>cssRules</code>, use the&nbsp;<code>CSSStyleSheet</code>'s <code>insertRule()</code> and <code>deleteRule()</code> methods.</p>
 

#### **Type**: [`CSSRuleList`](./css-rule-list.md)

### .ownerRule <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#ownerRule}

If this stylesheet is imported into the document using an <code>@import</code> rule, the <code>ownerRule</code> property returns the corresponding <code>CSSImportRule</code>; otherwise, this property's value is <code>null</code>.

#### **Type**: [`CSSRule`](./css-rule.md)

## Methods

### .deleteRule *(index)* <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#deleteRule}

Deletes the rule at the specified index into the stylesheet's rule list.

#### **Arguments**:


 - index `number`. The index into the stylesheet's <code>CSSRuleList</code> indicating the rule to be removed.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### .insertRule *(rule, index?)* <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#insertRule}

Inserts a new rule at the specified position in the stylesheet, given the textual representation of the rule.

#### **Arguments**:


 - rule `string`. <p>A `string` containing the rule to be inserted. What the inserted rule must contain depends on its type:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>**For rule-sets**, both a selector and a style declaration.</li>
      <li>**For at-rules**, both an at-identifier and the rule content.</li>
     </ul>
 - index `number`. A positive integer less than or equal to <code>stylesheet.cssRules.length</code>, representing the newly inserted rule's position in <code>CSSStyleSheet.cssRules</code>. The default is <code>0</code>. (In older implementations, this was required. See <a href="#Browser_compatibility">Browser compatibility</a> for details.)

#### **Arguments**:


 - start `number`. An index into the <code>Blob</code> indicating the first byte to include in the new <code>Blob</code>. If you specify a negative value, it's treated as an offset from the end of the <code>Blob</code> toward the beginning. For example, -10 would be the 10th from last byte in the <code>Blob</code>. The default value is 0. If you specify a value for <code>start</code> that is larger than the size of the source <code>Blob</code>, the returned <code>Blob</code> has size 0 and contains no data.
 - end `number`. An index into the <code>Blob</code> indicating the first byte that will *not* be included in the new <code>Blob</code> (i.e. the byte exactly at this index is not included). If you specify a negative value, it's treated as an offset from the end of the <code>Blob</code> toward the beginning. For example, -10 would be the 10th from last byte in the <code>Blob</code>. The default value is <code>size</code>.
 - contentType `string`. The content type to assign to the new <code>Blob</code>; this will be the value of its <code>type</code> property. The default value is an empty string.

#### **Returns**: `Promise<Blob>`

### .text *()* <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#text}

Returns a promise that resolves with a `string` containing the entire contents of the <code>Blob</code> interpreted as UTF-8 text.

These actions include retrieving, setting, adding to, and removing headers from the list of the request's headers.</span> A <code>Headers</code> object has an associated header list, which is initially empty and consists of zero or more name and value pairs.  <span style="line-height: 19.0909080505371px;">You can add to this using methods like <code>append()</code> (see <a href="#Examples">Examples</a>.) </span>In all methods of this interface, header names are matched by case-insensitive byte sequence. </div>

<div class='overview'>For security reasons, some headers can only be controlled by the user agent. These headers include the forbidden header names  and forbidden response header names.</div>

<div class='overview'>A Headers object also has an associated guard, which takes a value of <code>immutable</code>, <code>request</code>, <code>request-no-cors</code>, <code>response</code>, or <code>none</code>. This affects whether the <code>set()</code>, <code>delete()</code>, and <code>append()</code> methods will mutate the header. For more information see Guard.</div>

<div class='overview'>You can retrieve a <code>Headers</code> object via the <code>Request.headers</code> and <code>Response.headers</code> properties, and create a new <code>Headers</code> object using the <code>Headers.Headers()</code> constructor.</div>

<div class='overview'>An object implementing <code>Headers</code> can directly be used in a <code>for...of</code> structure, instead of <code>entries()</code>: <code>for (var p of myHeaders)</code> is equivalent to <code>for (var p of myHeaders.entries())</code>.</div>

<div class='overview'>The <strong><code>CSSRule</code></strong> interface represents a single CSS rule. There are several types of rules, listed in the <a href="#Type_constants">Type constants</a> section below.</div>

<div class='overview'>The <code>CSSRule</code> interface specifies the properties common to all rules, while properties unique to specific rule types are specified in the more specialized interfaces for those rules' respective types.</div>

<div class='overview'>References to a <code>CSSRule</code> may be obtained by looking at a <code>CSSStyleSheet</code>'s <code>cssRules</code> list.</div>

## Properties

### .cssText <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#cssText}

Represents the textual representation of the rule, e.g. "<code>h1,h2 { font-size: 16pt }</code>" or "<code>@import 'url'</code>". To access or modify parts of the rule (e.g. the value of "font-size" in the example) use the properties on the&nbsp;<a href="#Type_constants">specialized interface for the rule's type</a>.

#### **Type**: `Promise<string>`

### .parentRule <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#parentRule}

Returns the containing rule, otherwise <code>null</code>. E.g. if this rule is a style rule inside an <code>@media</code> block, the parent rule would be that <code>CSSMediaRule</code>.

#### **Type**: [`CSSRule`](./css-rule.md)

### .parentStyleSheet <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#parentStyleSheet}

Returns the <code>CSSStyleSheet</code> object for the style sheet that contains this rule

#### **Type**: [`CSSStyleSheet`](./css-style-sheet.md)

### .type <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#type}

One of the <a href="#Type_constants">Type constants</a> indicating the type of CSS rule.

#### **Type**: `Promise<number>`
# [AwaitedDOM](../basic-client/awaited-dom) <span>/</span> SuperNode

<div class='overview'><span class="seoSummary"><strong><code>Node</code></strong> is an interface from which various types of DOM API objects inherit, allowing those types to be treated similarly; for example, inheriting the same set of methods, or being testable in the same way.</span></div>

<div class='overview'>All of the following interfaces inherit the <code>Node</code> interface's methods and properties: <code>Document</code>, <code>Element</code>, <code>Attr</code>, <code>CharacterData</code> (which <code>Text</code>, <code>Comment</code>, and <code>CDATASection</code> inherit), <code>ProcessingInstruction</code>, <code>DocumentFragment</code>, <code>DocumentType</code>, <code>Notation</code>, <code>Entity</code>, <code>EntityReference</code></div>

<div class='overview'>Those interfaces may return <code>null</code> in certain cases where the methods and properties are not relevant. They may throw an exception — for example when adding children to a node type for which no children can exist.</div>

# AwaitedDOM

> AwaitedDOM is a NodeJs implementation of W3C's DOM specification that makes it easy to call properties and methods located in a remote browser engine as if they were local to your scraper script context.

AwaitedDOM currently implements a subset of the full DOM specification. Most of the readonly properties and methods have been implemented, however we haven't added DOM manipulation APIs because we believe they are too easy to detect by website bot blockers.

```js
const link = await hero.document.querySelector('a').href;
```

Explore the DOM classes listed on this page to see what has been implemented. You'll find a list of the unimplemented methods and properties located at the bottom of each page.

## Hero DOM Extensions

AwaitedDOM adds several DOM extensions to make Hero easier to use. These extensions are prefixed with the "$" character to keep "non-standard" methods/properties separate from the standard implementation. You can find the [full list here](../basic-client/awaited-dom-extensions.md).

```js
await hero.querySelector('.element').$click();
```

# [AwaitedDOM](../basic-client/awaited-dom) <span>/</span> Event

<div class='overview'><span class="seoSummary">The <code><strong>Event</strong></code> interface represents an event which takes place in the DOM.</span></div>

<div class='overview'>An event can be triggered by the user action e.g. clicking the mouse button or tapping keyboard, or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an asynchronous task. It can also be triggered programmatically, such as by calling the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click" title="The HTMLElement.click() method simulates a mouse click&nbsp;on an element."><code>HTMLElement.click()</code></a>&nbsp;method of an&nbsp;element, or by defining&nbsp;the&nbsp;event, then sending&nbsp;it to a specified target&nbsp;using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent" title="Dispatches an Event at the specified EventTarget, (synchronously) invoking the affected EventListeners in the appropriate order. The normal event processing rules (including the capturing and optional bubbling phase) also apply to events dispatched manually with dispatchEvent()."><code>EventTarget.dispatchEvent()</code></a>.</div>

<div class='overview'>There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main <code>Event</code> interface. <code>Event</code> itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events.</div>

<div class='overview'>Many DOM elements can be set up to accept (or "listen" for) these events, and execute code in response to process (or "handle") them.

# Introduction

> Hero is a free and open source headless browser that's written in NodeJs, built on top of Chrome, and designed for easy and reliable scraping.

A few cool highlights about Hero:

- [x] **Built for scraping** - it's the first modern headless browsers designed specifically for scraping instead of just automated testing.
- [x] **Designed for web developers** - We've recreated a fully compliant DOM directly in NodeJS allowing you bypass the headaches of previous scraper tools.
- [x] **Powered by Chrome** - The powerful Chrome engine sits under the hood, allowing for lightning fast rendering.
- [x] **Emulates any modern browser** - Emulators make it easy to disguise your script as practically any browser.
- [x] **Avoids detection along the entire stack** - Don't be blocked because of TLS fingerprints in your networking stack.

## Installation

To get started using Hero in your project, we have a "playground" that allows you to run examples out of the box. It can be installed using the following commands:

```bash
npm i --save @ulixee/hero-playground
```

or

```bash
yarn add @ulixee/hero-playground
```

You can drop the "-playground" whenever you want and use Hero directly (the core functionality is exactly the same):

```bash
npm i --save @ulixee/hero
```

or

```bash
yarn add @ulixee/hero
```

Just make sure your Ulixee development environment is setup and ready to go, such as making sure [`@ulixee/cloud`](https://ulixee.org/docs/cloud) is installed and running:

```bash
npx @ulixee/cloud start
```

## Usage

Hero provides access to the W3C DOM specification without the need for Puppeteer's complicated evaluate callbacks and multi-context switching:

```js
const Hero = require('@ulixee/hero-playground');

(async () => {
  const hero = new Hero();
  await hero.goto('https://example.org');
  const title = await hero.document.title;
  const intro = await hero.document.querySelector('p').textContent;
  await hero.close();
})();
```

# Configuration

Configuration variables can be defined at a few levels:

- `Hero` At an instance level, configured via [new Hero()](../basic-client/hero.md#constructor).
- `Connection` At a connection level, which can be configured when creating a new [ConnectionToCore](../advanced-client/connection-to-core.md#configuration).
- `Core` At an internal level, using the `@ulixee/hero-core` module of Hero. This must be run in the environment where your Browser Engine(s) and `@ulixee/hero-core` module are running. If you're running remote, this will be your server.

The internal `@ulixee/hero-core` module can receive several configuration options on [start](#core-start.md), or when a new [connection](../advanced-client/connection-to-core.md) is established.

### Connection To Core <div class="specs"><i>Hero</i></div>

The [ConnectionToCore](../advanced-client/connection-to-core.md) to be used by one or more [Hero](../basic-client/hero.md) instances.

All [configurations](../advanced-client/connection-to-core#configurations) accept both an `options` object and a [`ConnectionToCore`](../advanced-client/connection-to-core.md) instance.

### Max Concurrent Heroes Count <div class="specs"><i>Core</i></div>

Limit concurrent Heroes operating at any given time across all [connections](../advanced-client/connection-to-core.md) to a "Core". Defaults to `10`.

Configurable via [`Core.start()`](#core-start.md) or [`ConnectionToCore`](../advanced-client/connection-to-core.md#configuration).

### Data Dir <div class="specs"><i>Connection</i><i>Core</i></div> {#data-dir}

Configures the storage location for files created by Core.

- Session Databases
- Man-in-the-middle network certificates

`Environmental variable`: `ULX_DATA_DIR=/your-absolute-dir-path`

Configurable via [`Core.start()`](#core-start.md) or the first [`ConnectionToCore`](../advanced-client/connection-to-core.md).

### Blocked Resource Types <div class="specs"><i>Connection</i><i>Hero</i></div> {#blocked-resources}

One of the best ways to optimize Hero's memory and CPU is setting `blockedResourceTypes` to block resources you don't need. The following are valid options.

<p class="show-table-header show-bottom-border minimal-row-height"></p>

| Options          | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `JsRuntime`      | Executes JS in webpage. Requires `AwaitedDOM`.                     |
| `BlockJsAssets`  | Blocks all referenced script assets.                               |
| `BlockCssAssets` | Blocks all referenced CSS assets.                                  |
| `BlockImages`    | Blocks all referenced images on page.                              |
| `BlockFonts`     | Blocks all referenced fonts on page.                               |
| `BlockIcons`     | Blocks all referenced icons on page.                               |
| `BlockMedia`     | Blocks all referenced media on page.                               |
| `BlockAssets`    | Shortcut for `BlockJsAssets`, `BlockCssAssets` and `BlockImages`.  |
| `All`            | Blocks all of the resources above. Only retrieves window.response. |
| `None`           | No assets are blocked. `default`                                   |

As you'll notice above, some features are dependent on others and therefore automatically enable other features.

Setting an empty array is the same as setting to `None`.

### Blocked Urls<div class="specs"><i>Connection</i><i>Hero</i></div> {#blocked-urls}

Similar to [`Blocked Resource Types`](#blocked-resources), this allows you to block resources
from being loaded. Instead of focusing on the type of resource we are focussing on the url instead.

Wild cards can be used as well.

Examples:

```
http://example.com
example.com
*.example.com
*example.com
```

### User Profile <div class="specs"><i>Connection</i><i>Hero</i></div>

A user profile stores and restores Cookies, DOM Storage and IndexedDB records for an Hero. NOTE: the serialized user profile passed into an Hero instance is never modified. If you want to update a profile with changes, you should re-export and save it to the format you're persisting to.

```js
const rawProfileJson = fs.readFileSync('profile.json', 'utf-8');
const profile = JSON.parse(rawProfileJson); // { cookies: { sessionId: 'test' }}

const hero = new Hero({ userProfile: profile });
const latestUserProfile = await hero.exportUserProfile();
// { cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, indexedDBs }

await hero.goto('http://example.com');

const latestUserProfile = await hero.exportUserProfile();

fs.writeFileSync('profile.json', JSON.stringify(latestUserProfile, null, 2));
```

### Upstream Proxy Url <div class="specs"><i>Hero</i></div>

Configures a proxy url to route traffic through for a given Hero. This function supports two types of proxies:

- `Socks5` - many VPN providers allow you to use a socks5 configuration to send traffic through one of their VPNs behind the scenes. You can pass any required username and password through the `UserInfo` portion of the url, e.g., `socks5://username:password@sockshost.com:1080`.
- `Http` - an http proxy will create secure TLS socket to an upstream server using the HTTP connect verb. Services like [luminati](https://luminati.io) provide highly configurable Http proxies that can route traffic from various geographic locations and "grade" of IP - ie, consumer IP vs datacenter.

An upstream proxy url should be a fully formatted url to the proxy. If your proxy is socks5, start it with `socks5://`, http `http://` or `https://` as needed. An upstream proxy url can optionally include the user authentication parameters in the url. It will be parsed out and used as the authentication.

## Core Configuration

Configuration for Core should be performed before initialization.

### Core.start *(options)* {#core-start}

Update existing settings.

#### **Arguments**:

- options `object` Accepts any of the following:
  - maxConcurrentClientCount `number` defaults to `10`. Limit concurrent Hero sessions running at any given time.
  - dataDir `string` defaults to `os.tmpdir()/.ulixee`. Directory to store session databases and mitm certificates.
  - defaultUnblockedPlugins `IAgentPluginClass[]`. A list of [Unblocked Plugin](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/specification) classes to be installed by default in new Agents.

#### **Returns**: `Promise`
# Basic Concepts

Hero is not the only programable browser library -- Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium, and others all have their advantages. But when it comes to scraping, Hero was built to shine.

## Each Hero Instance Is a Unique User

- user-agent
- ip address
- cookies & storage
- screen details
- audio fingerprint (todo)
- fonts (todo)
- webgl / canvas  (todo)
- 100s more

Note: IP addresses are set through upstreamProxyUrl on each Hero.

## The DOM Has Been Awaited

The easiest way to explain Dynamic DOM is with some comparison examples. Let's say you want to load a URL and loop through a list of items.

### Doing It with Hero

Here's how you would do it with Hero:

```js
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero-playground';

const { document } = hero;

const elems = document.querySelectorAll('ul');
for (const elem of await elems) {
  console.log('SELECT FROM items WHERE id=?', [await elem.id]);
  // ^^ WORKS
}
```

Hero's Awaited DOM allows you to keep all calls within your script context. It also follows the W3C spec to a T. In fact, go ahead and copy lines 3 through 7 and run paste them into your browser's DevTools. They run perfectly.

### Doing It with Puppeteer

Here's how you would do it with Puppeteer:

```js
const Puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

const selector = 'ul li';
page.evaluate(
  (selector, db) => {
    const elems = document.querySelectorAll(selector);
    for (const elem of elems) {
      console.log('SELECT FROM items WHERE id=?', [elem.id]);
      // ^^ BREAKS
    }
  },
  selector,
  db,
);
```

As you'll notice, the above example throws an error. Although you can pass arguments into a remote method, they must be serializable, which means you can only pass through simple types.

When used in a simple example as show above, Puppeteer's approach seems okay. However, the reality is, most scraper scripts are complex, and your code becomes littered with multiple contexts, adding context to an already complex environment.

## Headless Browsers Need Not Always Render

When you're trying to eke out performance, a common technique is to disable rendering various parts of a webpage. Hero allows you to [turn off](../overview/configuration.md#blocked-resources) everything from the style and images of a page, to the javascript environment. You can even simulate making http requests from inside a loaded web page, without ever loading the page.

```js
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero-playground';

const hero = new Hero({
  blockedResourceTypes: ['All'],
});
await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
// referer will be https://ulixee.org
const doc = await hero.fetch('https://ulixee.org/docs/hero/overview/configuration');
```

Next to `blockedResourceTypes` you can also use `blockedResourceUrls`,
see [here](../overview/configuration.md#blocked-urls) for more information.

## Mice and Keyboards Are Human Too

Hero drives mice and keyboards with [Human Emulators](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/plugins/default-human-emulator). Human emulators translate your clicks and moves into randomized human-like patterns that can pass bot-blocker checks.
# Migrating from SecretAgent

If you're migrating a script from SecretAgent, you can expect to find:

- a more developer-friendly set of APIs (like our [AwaitedDOM Extenders](../basic-client/awaited-dom-extensions.md))
- a much better experience running in "headed" mode during development, while still supporting headless for production.
- features that let you react to the changing state/flow of a web page ([FlowHandlers](../basic-client/flow-handling.md))
- a much slimmer version of SecretAgent. Non-core functions have been exported: Remote is moved out to @ulixee/cloud; Replay is in a new tool called ChromeAlive!; the internal "Puppet" engine is now in the [Unblocked](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked) project.

Otherwise, Hero is an evolution of SecretAgent (and started from a git fork). You'll mostly just need to copy/replace of `const { Agent } = require('secret-agent')` with `const Hero = require('@ulixee/hero-playground')`.

```js
import { Agent } from 'secret-agent';

async function run() {
  const agent = new Agent();
  await agent.goto('https://example.org/');
  await agent.waitForPaintingStable();

  const html = await agent.document.documentElement.outerHTML;
  const title = await agent.document.title;
  const intro = await agent.document.querySelector('p').textContent;
  await agent.close();
}

run().catch(error => console.log(error));
```

```js
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero-playground';

async function run() {
  const hero = new Hero();
  await hero.goto('https://example.org/');
  await hero.waitForPaintingStable();

  const html = await hero.document.documentElement.outerHTML;
  const title = await hero.document.title;
  const intro = await hero.querySelector('p').textContent;
  await hero.close();
}

run().catch(error => console.log(error));
```

## No more Default Agent

If you were using the default "Agent" from `const agent = require('secret-agent')`, you'll need to move to a mode of constructing a Hero object for each session.

## Client Library

## Server Setup

If you use a Client/Server Setup, you'll find that we moved the `Server` module out of SecretAgent, and into [@ulixee/cloud][cloud]. You get the same functionality out of the box - a Server you can install on a machine and your DOM, interactions and other commands all serialize seamlessly.

To avoid installing the whole Chrome infrastructure on your client side, you can use the light client - `npm i @ulixee/hero`. It's the equivalent of `@secret-agent/client`.

## Handlers

Hero doesn't have a Handler or Server directly in the project. [@ulixee/cloud][cloud] is the new approach for setting up a remote server, and we've decided to go a new direction for our preferred deployment strategy. The new strategy is called [Datastores][datastore], and greatly improves efficiency and has a much simpler remote deployment (well, it will soon :).

Datastores focus on creating a remotely callable "function" that wraps a Hero script in a composable "unit". You can vary inputs and collect outputs, or retry a script from a new IP address without having to think much about how to do that yourself.

If you want to keep a model where you are using "driving" a script by queuing up a local "Client" that executes remotely (ie, like a SecretAgent Handler). To achieve client-size load-balancing, we recommend migrating to a tool like [`p-queue`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-queue). We've included an example in the Hero repo ([here](https://github.com/ulixee/hero/blob/27e1966c636f47519ed5d1ccc22273c1215855c1/examples/ulixee.org.ts)).

## BrowserEmulators and HumanEmulators

If you created a custom BrowserEmulator or HumanEmulator, those "concepts" have been merged into a single type of Plugin called an [Unblocked Plugin][unblocked-plugin]. You can see our plugins ported to the new format [here](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/plugins). We're planning to break up the BrowserEmulator into a series of smaller plugins with the end vision of making it far simpler to add workarounds as you find the need to add bot-blocker evasions.

## Puppet

To that end, the library that was formally passed into "Plugins" and "Human/Browser" Emulators has been merged with some parts of SecretAgent Core to form the [Unblocked Agent][unblocked-agent]. The Unblocked Agent is now under it's own development lifecycle and has been put into a much tighter loop with DoubleAgent (aka, detection) development. We envision Hero as the home of scraper productivity tooling, and Unblocked as the home of the bot cat and mouse game.

## Plugins

If you wrote a Core Plugin, you'll notice that the API callbacks have changed slightly. Callbacks and variables no longer have "puppet" in the name, since they're now part of [Unblocked Agent][unblocked-agent].

## Replay

If you were using Replay with SecretAgent (sorry Windows users...), it's now part of the new Ulixee Desktop tooling. You can download the [Ulixee.app](https://github.com/ulixee/platform/releases/latest.md) install.

# Troubleshooting

### Installation Errors or ENOENT

Hero operates with a few different spawned processes:

#### Browser Emulators

When you install Hero, it also downloads a recent version of Chrome and emulator "data files" to mask automated and headless usage. Details of the underlying [Browser Emulators]](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked/tree/main/plugins/default-browser-emulator) can be found in the [Unblocked](https://github.com/ulixee/unblocked) project.

Browsers will be saved to a shared location on each OS. Each browser version will be downloaded only once and can be shared across multiple Hero npm installations.

- Mac: ~/Library/Cache/
- Linux: ~/.cache (environment variable XDG_CACHE_HOME)
- Windows: ~/AppData/Local (environment variable LOCALAPPDATA)

### Debugging Logs

By default, Hero logs everything to a [Session](../advanced-concepts/sessions.md) database that is created per Hero instance. The SessionLogs table contains all debug logs.

To output logs to the console during operation, you can set the environmental variable `DEBUG=true`.

```js
process.env.DEBUG = true;
import Hero from '@ulixee/hero';

(async () => {
  const hero = new Hero();
  await hero.goto('https://url.com');
})();
```

If you'd like to customize log output, you can inject your own logger so long as it supports these methods:

- `stats(action: string, data?: ILogData): number`
- `info(action: string, data?: ILogData): number`
- `warn(action: string, data?: ILogData): number`
- `error(action: string, data?: ILogData): number`
- `createChild(module: NodeModule, boundContext: any): ILog` Must return a new logger that retains the given boundContext state.


_*NOTE:*_ you must initialize this Logger BEFORE any Hero code is accessed.

For example:

```js
const debug = require('debug')('MyHero');
const Logger = require('@ulixee/commons/Logger');

let logId = 0;

class CustomLogger {
  level: string;
  constructor(module, boundContext) {
    this.boundContext = boundContext;
    this.filename = module.filename;
  }
  stats(action, data) {
    debug(`STATS ${action}`, data);
    return (logId += 1);
  }
  info(action, data) {
    debug(`INFO ${action}`, data);
    return (logId += 1);
  }
  warn(action, data) {
    debug(`WARN ${action}`, data);
    return (logId += 1);
  }
  error(action, data) {
    debug(`ERROR ${action}`, data);
    return (logId += 1);
  }
  createChild(module, boundContext) {
    const Constructor = this.constructor;
    // @ts-ignore
    return new Constructor(module, {
      ...this.boundContext,
      ...boundContext,
    });
  }
  flush() {}
}

injectLogger(module => {
  return {
    log: new CustomLogger(module),
  };
});
```

From your main script:

```
require('./CustomLogger.js');
const HeroCore = require('@ulixee/hero-core');

// your code...

```

### Problems after an upgrade

If you have problems after upgrading, [let us know](https://github.com/ulixee/hero/issues).
# How to upgrade

Follow **one** of these steps to upgrade Hero to latest version.

- With **yarn** run `yarn upgrade @ulixee/hero --latest`
- With **npm** run `npm install @ulixee/hero@latest`

### Problems after upgrading
If you have problems after upgrading, [let us know](https://github.com/ulixee/hero/issues).
# Prerequisites

To get started with Hero, you’ll need to have the following software tools installed:

### Node.js

Visit the [Node.js site](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the instructions to download and install the recommended version for your operating system. Once you have followed the installation steps, make sure everything was installed properly:

Open up your terminal.
- Run `node --version`. (If you’re new to the command-line, “run command” means “type node --version in the command prompt, and hit the Enter key”. From here on, this is what we mean by “run command”).
- Run `npm --version`.
- **The output of each of those commands should be a version number**. If entering those commands doesn’t show you a version number, go back and make sure you have installed **Node.js**.


### Yarn (Optional)
Yarn is a fast alternative to Npm. It's optional to install, but recommended since we use it in many code examples.
**Follow instruction here to install**: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
